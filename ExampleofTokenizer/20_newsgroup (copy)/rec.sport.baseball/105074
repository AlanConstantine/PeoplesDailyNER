	The only problem is, Dave Kingman was *always* taking off.
Rosh Hashana, Yom Kippur, Easter, the day Elvis died (8/16), the entire
spring training month of Ramadan, Purim, the 4th of July (both games 
that day), my birthday (OK, during the World Series, he never had to 
play there), Memorial day (both games that day), ...
	Guys, help me out here.  I've run fresh out of holidays that 
coincide with the baseball season and I'm trying to catalogue all the
days in his career that Dave Kingman (or at least his bat) went AWOL.
	A complete religious calendar detailing every holiday in every
extant religion in the Western Hemisphere would be appreciated.  Only
then can we truly be certain that Dave Kingman observed every holiday
ever conceived...
	:-), of course ...NOT!

	Viola has only played in the NL with the Mets -- not possible for him
to have defeated or lost to every team.  Ditto for Tanana who was mentioned
in a previous post.

	I don't remember if Seaver managed to get a win against the White Sox
in his brief sojourn with Boston so I'd say the other pitcher to defeat every
team is either Mike Torrez (he bounced around enough for a long enough period
of time) or Koosman as mentioned.  I would also guess that if one of these
two did not manage to beat every team he did manage to lose to every team.

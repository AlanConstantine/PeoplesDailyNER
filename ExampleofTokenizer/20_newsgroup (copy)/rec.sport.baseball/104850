So THAT'S what happened to Denny McLain.  Sad.

For those of you who are interested, another baseball pariah,
Pete Rose, has a weekday radio show on the Sports and
Entertainment national radio network.  I think it's 3-5 PM
locally, 6-8 PM on the East coast.

And actually, his on-air monologues about the baseball
business sounds a lot more reasonable and articulate
than what I hear from the Ray Knights of the world.

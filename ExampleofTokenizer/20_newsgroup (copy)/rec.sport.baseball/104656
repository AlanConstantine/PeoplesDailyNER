Major League Baseball is trying to expand its appeal to people with shorter
attention spans (i.e. the football crowd). (-:  Invariably, all the
arguments from people who don't like to watch baseball on T.V. say the
same thing:  the games are too long and too boring.  Baseball is trying
to find a way to shorten the games for wider T.V. appeal.  If you look at
it, though, baseball games last around the same amount of time as football
games.  The difference is that there is "more action" in that duration in
football games.  Perhaps if there were "more action" in baseball games, you
would get more of those fans to tune in.  Anyway, coming up with a solution
to make baseball more appealing to a bigger crowd is going to be difficult.
[On soapbox] Yet another reason to get a commisioner NOW since it's obvious
that ruling baseball by comittee works about as fast as a snail race in
Nebraska. [Off soapbox]

    That's because Lankford had a minor injury from a couple of games
before that
    and was day-to-day... only available as a pinchrunner.

     See above.

    At the beginning of the interview Torre also said Lankford is the
one outfield
    guy who's "in there no matter what".
    My guess is Jordan will eventually end up being odd man out due to low
    on base percentage.  Whiten was a great acquisition... decent offense
    and great defense in rightfield.  But don't worry, Gilkey will be
starting        
    as soon as Jordan or Whiten displays an extended period of low offensive
    output.

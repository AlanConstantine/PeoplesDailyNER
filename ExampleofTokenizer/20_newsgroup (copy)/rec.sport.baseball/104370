	This list brings to mind possible the worst trade since Babe for
	NONO NANNETTE, i.e., Milt Pappas for Frank Robinson, I think in
	1965 ?. Robinson proceeded to win the triple crown in 1966 and
	may have beaten out Yaz in '67 but was injured on a slide into 
	second when he collided with the mighty Al Weis (Chisox).

>>(Look at all that Teal!!!!  BLEAH!!!!!!!!!)

Indeed, if the color teal on a team's uniforms is any indication of the
future, the Marlins are in dire trouble! Refer to the San Jose Sharks for
proof... But I have hope for the Marlins. I was a sometime member of the
Rene Lachemann fan club at the Oakland Coliseum, and have a deep respect
for the guy. He's a gem. And, of course, Walt Weiss gives that franchise
class. But yeah... whoever designed those uniforms was guilty of a paucity
of style and imagination. Ugghhh!

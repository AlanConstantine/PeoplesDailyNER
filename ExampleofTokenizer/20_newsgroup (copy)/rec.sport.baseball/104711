There is a great book out called "They Also Served" which is about the 
ballplayers during WWII.  There is some info on Berg in there.  It also has 
info on Pete Gray (one armed outfielder) and other players of the era.  Because
of the draft many players during the war were those who were exempt from the
draft for medical reasons.  There are some very interesting stories in the
book. It is very well written and I would suggest reading it to anyone with an 
interest in baseball.

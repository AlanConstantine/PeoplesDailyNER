I'm a season ticket holder and have a pair of S.F. Giants tickets available for
every game except opening day. They're located in lower reserved, section 3, 
row 2. They're two rows (about 5 feet) behind the MVP lower box seats that
go for $17.25/apiece. I'm selling my tickets for $25/pair. Here's the 
schedule for the next 8 weeks. E-mail me if you're interested.

As long as the Yankees are in the same division the Red Sox will
play better than .500 baseball.

Or the Red Sox can hire former East German swimming coaches to
"train" them at the fine art of body "building". The Red Sox
can use Chinese women swimmers as a reference.

With the "HAWK", the Red Sox definitely have a chance for the
east this year. He brings class, work ethic and leadership to
the park each day. And he has a burning desire to play in the
World Series.

Future Hall-of-Famer, Andre Dawson will kick butt in Boston!

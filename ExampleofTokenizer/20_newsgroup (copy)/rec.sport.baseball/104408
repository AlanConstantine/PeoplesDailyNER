Why?  Do you suppose he's immune to the ravages of time?  He's 37.  
In a few years he'll be 40.  He doesn't get to as many grounders as
he used to, and will get to fewer still as his legs go, as they do
on every human so far.

Remember: Willie Mays was a defensive liability at he end of his
career too.  Ditto Mickey Mantle.  Ditto just about everyone else who 
played into their late 30's.

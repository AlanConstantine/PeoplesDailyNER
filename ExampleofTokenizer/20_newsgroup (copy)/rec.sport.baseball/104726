For an expansion team?  I'm pretty sure I would go with the rings, as long
as their salaries and ages weren't too high.  I would want the fans to be 
able to identify the players.  I would like a championship attitude in the 
clubhouse.

As for Larkin and Griffin?  Salaries aside, I would have to consider which
player is likeliest to contribute to a WS victory.  Past performance, age and
attitude would all be integral to my decision.  I certainly wouldn't just
haul out my copy of Gillete and pick Larkin, as many others would.  And,
unlike many others who post to this group, I hardly consider myself quali-
fied to make those kinds of decisions.

I have never been able to believe it about myself, to tell you the truth.
It's like banging your head against a stone wall.

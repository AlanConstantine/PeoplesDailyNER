I believe he was well out of baseball by the time he died.

Uh, he also has been charged with chasing his wife in a car, and smashing it
into a tree, as well as carrying a loaded firearm in his car. And the 
speeding reported was over 100 mph; reckless driving.

Actually, I hadn't heard about this; thanks.

I don't know what you were reading or watching, but I sure saw a LOT about 
that, and about Dykstra's poker games. Most of the writing was along the lines
of how incredibly stupid and selfish it was, and how he'd hurt the team by
wracking himself and the catcher up, etc. ESPN raised questions about his
judgement, etc. The print media here in the SF area questioned why disciplinary
action wouldn't be taken against Dykstra, and one article pointed out that if
Lenny wanted to kill himself, there were ways that wouldn't endanger other
people's lives. Then there was Dykstra himself being quoted on how stupid it
was, etc.

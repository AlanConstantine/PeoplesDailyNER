I don't really mind the length of games either.  If they want to speed
the games up in sensible ways, that's fine with me too.  However, what
I object to is the assertion by baseball people (Whitey Herzog, Buck
Rodgers are who I've heard say this) that games are too long because
hitters are taking too many pitches, and that the strike zone needs to
be expanded.

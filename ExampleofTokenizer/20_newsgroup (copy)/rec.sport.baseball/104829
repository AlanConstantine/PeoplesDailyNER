I don't understand this at all.  Matt Williams has demonstrated
throughout his career that he will NOT wait for good pitches to hit.
He won't take walks.  He'd rather swing.  If I'm the opposing pitcher,
why would I groove a fastball to Williams and have him hit it well,
when I know that Williams will swing (and miss, or at least not hit
very well) at a low and away curve?

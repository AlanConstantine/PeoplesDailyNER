This leads me to believe that it's not really a rabbitball year, and that
we've just had a rash of high-scoring games.  I bet this one day's worth
of games pulled everything back to close to average.

Interesting, because the other day, all but three games had ten or more
runs scored, and yesterday no game had more than nine.

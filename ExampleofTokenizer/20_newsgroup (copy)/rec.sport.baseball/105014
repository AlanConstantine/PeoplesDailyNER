Or a young Don Bordello...

There's a strong possibility that the Bucs have absolutely no other catching  
prospects in the minors at this point -- at least nobody ready for any serious  
AAA/majors duty.  The main reason they might have stayed with Prince could be  
just age, especially if Spanky was creeping toward his mid-30s or something.
 
All things considered, though, I'd be a lot more comfortable with Spanky behind  
the plate than Prince.  Isn't there decent backup backstop out there looking  
for work?

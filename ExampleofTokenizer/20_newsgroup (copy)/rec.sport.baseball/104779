The Red Sox usually have 2 catchers.  I don't think they have a backup now,
but they used to use Randy Kutcher as a backup catcher, as well as a middle
infielder and outfielder.  You don't need a good 3rd catcher, just a
competent one, so you can afford to lose a little catching ability and pick
a player who can be of use elsewhere on the field.

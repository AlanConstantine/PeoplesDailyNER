I think there is another formula for ERA.  I heard something about it last 
year.  Im not sure what it is, but im gonna give it a stab.  It allows for
a pitcher to pitch more than 9 innings at a time and not benefit, cuz it
uses outs recorded instead of innings pitched...

        ERA = (ER*27)/outs recorded

Like i said, im not sure this is exactly it, but im pretty sure they changed
it to something of the sort.

Well, yeah. On the other hand, for the first few years of his career he
looked like Herb Washington. Dan Gladden doesn't seem to suck defensively,
either.

Yeah, and how many of the white guys played one year into a long career?
It's actually not an uncommon phenomenon, and how long a guy hangs around
based on one good year seems like a reasonable question to explore on a
racial basis.

Hey, he plays for Lou Gorman, doesn't he? OK, so it's eight years.

Good point on Cedeno. OTOH, I haven't seen that extensive list of 10-year
Dan Gladdens, either. There really aren't that many players altogether who
hang around for 10 years even if they're reasonably good.

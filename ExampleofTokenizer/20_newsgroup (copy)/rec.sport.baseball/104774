Here's a few two-sport star trivia questions.  I'll admit they're not
too difficult, but a bit challenging nevertheless.

Mail me your answers please; or post them.


1.  Which pitcher played for the Harlem Globetrotters?

2.  Which major leaguer briefly tried professional golf in 1978?

3.  Which does Dieon Sanders have more of (professionally):
    career touchdowns or triples?

4.  Has there been any player of both pro hockey and baseball?
    If so, name him and the years he played each.


If you have any other two-sport star tidbits, feel free to include them.

Mike

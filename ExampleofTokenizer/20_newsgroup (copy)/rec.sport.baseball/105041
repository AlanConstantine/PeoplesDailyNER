Yeah, Morris just knows how to win. That's why he lost 18 for Detroit in
1990. Funny how he wins a lot of games when he pitches on good teams but
loses a lot when he pitches on bad ones. And if "rings" was the only
criteria for success, then teams would always tend to repeat, and
eventually you'd have the same team win the WS every bleepin' year. Sort
of like the yanks in the 50s.

Morris is a decent pitcher on the downside of a good, not great, career.
Toronto will finish 3rd or 4th this year, with Morris and all those
rings, because their pitching staff was destroyed over the off-season.

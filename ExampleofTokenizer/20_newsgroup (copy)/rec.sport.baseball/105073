And not the only quality Mariner pitcher.  I logged on expecting to see
at least ONE congratulatory note for Chris Bosio's NO HITTER, but nary
a peep.  

So I'll take this opportunity to note that the red feet are now 11-5 and
slinking out of town without having scored a run in the last two games
or even a hit in last night's gem.  

Not that we M's fans can compare our suffering to those of the followers
of New England's long-running tragedy, but only one winning season in
history is something of a burden to bear.  So we'll take our joys when
we can get 'em.  

The Mariners now have two no-hit pitchers on the staff and not
coincidentally those pitchers beat the Red Sox in back to back games.

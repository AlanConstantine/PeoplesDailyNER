So, that is the reason why the Toronto Blue Jays *should* keep Alfredo
Griffin, just because it "worked"?

A team winning doesn't mean that everything that it's doing is right.
A team not winning doesn't mean that everything that it's doing is wrong, or
otherwise (to borrow the Sharks' situation) you would say that George Kingston
should be fired.

By then, it's too late.  The problem with "not fixing something while it's
working" is that by then, there may not be anything left to fix.

So, the Blue Jays were simply perfect last year; there was nothing that they
could have done to have improved that team.  NOT.

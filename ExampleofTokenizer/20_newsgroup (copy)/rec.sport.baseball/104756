There's nothing wrong with a red neck.  Why, some of us hicks even
listen to cultured music and such, can you say the same?  Aside from
that, you shouldn't try to shit on this guy by insulting where YOU

yes, even like baseball.  So screw anyone that doesn't like it.

Oh yeah, learn the difference between to and too city-boy! (see below)

And you wrote an *excellent* report about it.

I understand (from an unreliable source) that Canseco was considered
expendable by the A's when he refused to accept any coaching about
his batting stance.  The A's brain trust came to believe that his
back problems were exacerbated, if not caused, by having a wide open
stance, closing it quickly and then swinging with a lot of torque
(that's a paraphrase of what I remember).

In any event, Canseco took the road that he and he alone would decide
his stance, and the A's began to believe that he would either reinjure
himself or begin to lose his ability to hit for both average and power.

Apparently, you sound like LaRussa.

>Second, drop 20 pounds.  Cut out the weight work.

The A's also objected about this.

Again, I'm just repeating something I heard.  But possibly the cause
and effect is the reverse of that.

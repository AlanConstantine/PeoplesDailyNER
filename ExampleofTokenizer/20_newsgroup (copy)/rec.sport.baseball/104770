I don't buy this at all.  I think things are colored to a very large
degree of preconceived notions of who the players involved are.  Try
this exercise:

XXX is pitching today.  His team scores 4 in the first inning, and 3
in the fourth.  XXX gives up 0 in the 1st through 4th.  In the fifth,
he gives up 3 runs.  In the 6th, he gives up 2 more.  The score is now
7-5, with XXX's team still on top.

I contend that if XXX were Jack Morris, the assessment would be "he is
a gutty veteran who pitches only as well as he has to to win."

If XXX were Mike Trmbley, the assessment would be "he is an
inexperienced rookie who doesn't know how to pitch.  Needs more
seasoning.  Send him to AAA.  Or to the spice rack."

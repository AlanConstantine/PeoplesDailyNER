I don't know if you could call him rushed, but "Big" Ben McDonald didn't
much time at all in the minors. Of course that was because the balls used
in AAA had seams too large and gave McDonald blisters forcing him to go
on the DL several times. He's done most of his learning here in the majors.
Of course Gregg "Wild Thing" Olson and Mike "Deserved a Cy Young" Mussina
didn't spend much time in the minors either. I read somewhere that pitchers
are less likely to need that much time in the minors anyway so maybe that
has something to do with it.
Let's go O's! Why Not?

Even I noticed that Gant's demeanor was not one of a batter
attempting to regain his concentration.  Gant was stalking off.
I wonder if Gant said something to the ump?

Actually, there was a small hand wave by Gant...as if to say
'Don't bother me'. Gant may have said something here, too.

Cox was already halfway to the ump when the strike was called.

My impression was that Gant was not 'stepping out.'  He was making
a protest about the lack of an appeal to first.  As has been
pointed out earlier, there is no appeal to first on a strike.
I can understand Gant feeling a little pressure in a two-out,
RISP, 1 - 0 game, ninth inning.  He let it get to him.  The ump
also overreacted.  Gant was stalking off, but I doubt he would
have been gone long.  Hirschbeck should have let him have a
moment to compose himself before telling him to come bat.
IMHO, umpires should be more flexible than what Hirschbeck
showed.  Gant was disturbed to the point it was pretty likely
he would not get a hit.

A very bad finish to a pretty good game.

Can anybody figure out why some box score abbreviations make
absolutely no sense?  (At least in the local Gannett rag that finds its way
to my door.)  I must have stared at "Cleman" in the Mets' box for a
good 30 seconds this morning wondering who the hell it was.  Wouldn't
it make more sense to use "Colemn"?

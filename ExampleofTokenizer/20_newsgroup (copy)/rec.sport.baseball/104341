Can someone send me ticket ordering information for the
following teams:  Baltimore, Philadelphia and Boston.

Also, if you have a home schedule available - can you tell me the dates
for all home games between July26-Aug6 and between Aug30-Sept10 and if
any of these games are promotion nights or special discount nights?

Thanks !!!  Ron

PS: and also who the opponents are for these games :-)

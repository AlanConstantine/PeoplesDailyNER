TWINS UPDATE --  Posted April 22, 1993  
---------------------------------------------
The Twins defeated the Milwaukee Brewers 5-4 today to conclude a three game
homestand with the Brew crew.  The Twins took two of three games in the series,
with scores as follows:

                  Tuesday April 20th    MN  10
                                        Mil  0
                   Winning Pitcher Banks (2-0)  

                  Wednesday April 21st  Mil 10  (10)
                                        MN   8
                    LP  - Hartley ( 0-1 )

                  Thursday April 22nd   MN  5
                                        Mil 4
                    WP - Deshaies (4-0)
                    Sa - Aguilera

Highlight/Low Lights of the Series:
------------------------------------
Jim Deshaies continues to be the surprise of not only the Twins, but of
the American League as well.  Going into today's game, Deshaies was 3-0
with a 1.74 ERA.  Deshaies allowed 2 Earned runs in 6 2/3 innings, meaning
his ERA will climb slightly.  Deshaies, who came to MN via a trade with
Philadelphia which sent David West there, continues to make Andy MacPhail
look like a true genius.

Willie Banks has put together two solid starts for the Twins, going 6.1 innings
on Monday while coasting on solid Twins hitting.  Deshaies and Banks now 
combine for 6 of the Twins eight victories, while Tapani/Mahomes/Erickson are
0-5.

Wednesday's game marked the first opposing left-handed starting pitcher for the
Twins this year (Rickey Bones).  The Twins teed off against both him and 
subsequent relief, including a Grand Slam by Kent Hrbek which pushed the lead
to 7-3.  The Twins pitching staff could not hold the lead, though, allowing
4 walks in the 7th inning, 2 of which scored and coming with bases loaded.
Tapani gave up one walk before being relieved, Guthrie two walks, and Mike
Hartley one walk before the inning was over.  This tied the game at 7-7, and
the Brew Crew rocked Mike Hartley for 3 runs in the top of the tenth to win
it.

Aguilera continues to be shaky against the Brew Crew.  6 of 20 career blown
saves have come against the Brew Crew, and today's game was shaky as well.
Coming into the ninth with a 5-2 lead, Aguilera gave up a solo HR to Vaughn,
then hits to Darryl Hamilton and Dickie Thon before finally retiring the
side.  Once again, the tying run made it to second base on Aggie.
Weak hearted Twins fans are advised not to watch Aggie in the ninth.

General News
-------------------------------------
Pedro Munoz continues to improve as an outfielder, playing in left field on
Tuesday's game.  He continues to bat weakly against right handed pitching,
though, which has limited his playing time.  Gene Larkin and JT Bruett(former
Gopher) have been playing right field, as both can bat left handed.

The Twins begin a three game series with the Detroit Tigers tomorrow.  Starting
Pitching is tentatively scheduled as Erickson, Mahomes, Banks.  The Detroit
Tigers have had TWO 20 run games in the last ten days, and should provide 
quite a challenge to the young MN pitching staff.

The Twins have 9 HR's this year, three each from Puckett, Hrbek, and Winfield,
the third, fourth, and fifth batters, respectively.

Brian Harper pegged 4 of the first 6 baserunners attempting to steal second
this year, and shows much improvement in this category.

Jim Deshaies has three pick-offs and one balk this year.  Some say he 
has the best 1st base move in baseball.  This move has enabled him to pitch
out of some tight early jams, and has certainly contributed to his 4-0 
start.  Watch to see if umpiring crews began calling the balk more tightly
in response to opposing team complaints about his leg kicking behind the
rubber on the pick-off move.

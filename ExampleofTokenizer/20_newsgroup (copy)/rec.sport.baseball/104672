I need a little help from a Texas Rangers expert.

I was at Yankee Stadium Sunday (12-2 Texas rout) with my kids.  We
wandered out to the outfield during Rangers batting practice and
I caught a ball tossed into the stands (actually wrestled some guy
a bit, I might add) by #62 on the Rangers.  Who is he?  Looked like
a bullpen assistant type, youngish I think.  He was not in the
roster listed in the Yankee scorecard.  Any ideas?

Please e-mail as I haven't been reading r.s.b regularly.

Thanks.
- Bob

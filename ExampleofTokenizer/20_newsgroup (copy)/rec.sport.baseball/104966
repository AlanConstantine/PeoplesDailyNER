But ingnoring putouts is biased in yet another way. Range is
not the only thing that makes a good firstbaseman. The ability
to field all sorts of balls thrown to him: digging some out of the
dirt, stretching for others, and so forth is important. Thus, 
putouts do provide some information.  Maybe what we need is a
comparision of how many balls were thrown to the area of the
first baseman vs. how many he actually got.

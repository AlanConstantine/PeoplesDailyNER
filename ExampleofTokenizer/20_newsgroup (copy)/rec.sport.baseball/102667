 I've a curiousity --

  Whenever a person is put on the 15-day, 30-day or 60-day, 
 the person is on the list longer than the specificed time

  I've seen a person on the 15-day for maybe 4 months last year, I don't
 remember what...

 I just need a little clarification on the disabled list specifications.

Both your reasons are not good ones.  Joe Morgan thinks that Bonds-Clark-
Williams should be the 3-4-5 hitters.  While he believes that Clark-Bonds-
Williams is fine, he definitely is of the opinion that Bonds should hit
ahead of Williams.  I am inclined to agree with him.
Your first reason is not valid because Bonds can hit both lefties and righties
very well.  He hits lefties or righties better than any other Giant
Williams is still getting breaking balls although not as much as last season.
But, the bottom line is Bonds is a far more disciplined and more productive
hitter than Williams, and I prefer to take my chances with Bonds driving in
the 1, 2 or 3 hitters (who are expected to have high OBPs) than with Williams.
Williams would get more fastballs with Bonds on first and second base open
because of the threat of Bonds stealing.

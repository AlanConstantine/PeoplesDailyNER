A HBP, but it reminds of my favorite (apochryphal ? sp ?) Don Drysdale story.

When ordered to intentionally walk a batter who had hot-dogged on him in
two previous at-bats, Drysdale reared back with the first pitch and
drilled him right in the ribs.

His manager came storming out of the dugout and yelled "What did you do that
for ?"

Drysdale growled back, "What are you complaining for ? I saved you three
pitches !"

Incidentally, if this is true, I'd love to know the other people involved.

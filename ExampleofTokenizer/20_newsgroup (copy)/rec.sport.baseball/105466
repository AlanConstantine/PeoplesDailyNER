My brother purchased baseball tickets for Texas Rangers vs Toronto
Bluejays in July, but he was unable to get vacation days to get there. 

Is anyone interested in purchasing the following:

Arlington Stadium

If you want them all, the total is $112.00

Please contact me over e-mail, or directly to my brother:

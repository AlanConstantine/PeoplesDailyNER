And he pitched many not-so-outstanding ballgames, too.

Jack essentially pitched a lot of .500 ball last year.  This certainly
isn't irrelevant, and iif you replace Morris with replacement level quality
the Blue Jays might not win.

Re leadership, I don't see it.  If the leadership effect is there for
a starting pitcher, you would expect to see its primary effect on the
pitching staff.  You would expect to see the rest of the staff improve.
Instead, the rest of the staff declined.

You can make a reasonable argument for Winfield providing leadership;
the offense picked up considerably from its effectiveness the previous
year. I'm not saying I buy that, but at least that argument makes
internal sense.

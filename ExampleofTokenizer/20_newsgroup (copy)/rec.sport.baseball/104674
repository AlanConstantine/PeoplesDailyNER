   I suppose a foul ball machine (like Brett Butler) is pretty valuable,

   actually hit the ball.

And I'd rather watch (and root for) a team that scores lots of runs
and wins games.

Of course, I'm rooting for the Rockies and Andres anyway.  But that's
for irrational hometown reaons.  I also root for Frank Thomas. :)

The answer is - they're stupid.  Seriously, I think you're right
on the money; I've never understood the preoccupation with making
sure a rotation has left-handed starters.  The only time it makes
sense to me is when you have an unbalanced schedule and your main
rival(s) is loaded with lefthanded hitters.  Other than that, I think
you're completely right.

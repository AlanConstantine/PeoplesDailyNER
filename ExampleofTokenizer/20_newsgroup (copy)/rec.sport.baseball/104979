How about Matt Nokes 2 run single against Ron Darling.  Was that a hit or what?  
While watching the game yesterday they flashed up something regarding The
Boss' talking about Mark Connor as bullpen coach.  He said something like it's
Mark Connor's fault that the bullpen is so horrible!!  Here we go again!! 
George sticking his non-baseball nose in the baseball business.  Shut up
George, just spend the money, get the players and leave Buck and the coaches
and players alone.

I saw the replay several times too.  No question about it.  Daryl missed
the ball, *then* the fan caught it.  Daryl is so tall that he had the
first shot at the ball.  Daryl's just whining again.  I think it shows a
lack of class when Tommy, Daryl and the Dodgers blame a single fan for
losing the game.  What about the pitcher who threw up the gopher ball?
What about the pitchers that gave up 6 runs up to that point?  Sorry, Tommy.
If it were a 2-1 game and Daryl was 5 feet 2 inches tall, then maybe -
just maybe - you'd have an argument.

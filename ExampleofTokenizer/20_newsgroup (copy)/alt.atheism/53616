Jon-

[and I thought to impress with my references!]

Ok, so you don't claim to have an absolute moral system.  Do you claim
to have an objective one?  I'll assume your answer is "yes," apologies
if not.

"Objective" means is that different observers will get the same results.
The observers may need to be trained in the use of the system.  I'd be
interested in seeing a summary of your system, though I appreciate that
it might take a great deal of effort to put it in writing.

In your post above you objected to "situational morals."  Perhaps you
could begin by explaining how you objectively set the situational
boundaries of an act, in your system.  I don't think you can do it.
Here's a game we could play that would illustrate my point.  I think of
a situation, and you have to say whether it is moral or not, and why.
In your move you can

	1) Ask me any objective question about the situation, or
	2) Pronounce judgement.

After you have pronounced judgement, I get to add whatever context I like
to the situation, provided I don't change anything I have already said.
If I can change the context to one where your objective system would give
a different answer, then your system is faulty.  (Since I don't know what
your system is, either you must write it down, or at least be consistent.)

Do you think your system could pass this test?

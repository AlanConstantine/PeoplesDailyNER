It is better than the crap that the creationists put out.  So far all they
have been able to manage is distortions and half-truths. (When they are not
taking quotes out of context...)

The genetic code has shown more about how man is realted to primates that the
fossil record.  (A little detail the creationists try and ignore.)

BR>            Good deeds do not justify a person in God's
BR> sight.            An atonement (Jesus) is needed to atone

Who says?  Your Bible(tm)?	I would be surprised if *ANY* Christian followed
all of the rules in the Bible.  (Most of them just pick and choose, according
to the local biases.)

BR>      My point: God is the creator.  Look's like we agree.

Where is your proof?  How do you know it was *YOUR* God?

BR>      I'll send you some info via e-mail.
BR>      Regards, Bill.

Why not post them?	I would be interested in seeing them myself.

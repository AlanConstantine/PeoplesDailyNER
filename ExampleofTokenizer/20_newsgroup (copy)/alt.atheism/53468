Fred Rice answered this already in an early posting:
"The problem with your argument is that you do not _know_ who is a _real_
believer and who may be "faking it".  This is something known only by
the person him/herself (and God).  Your assumption that anyone who
_claims_ to be a "believer" _is_ a "believer" is not necessarily true."

In other words it seems that nobody could define who is a true and
false Muslim. We are back to square one, Khomeini and Hussein are 
still innocent and can't be defined as evil or good Islamic 
worshippers.

Cheers,
Kent

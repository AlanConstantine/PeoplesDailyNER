I was talking to the head of the archeology dept. once in college and
the topic of Mormon archeology came up.  It seems that the Mormon church
is (or was) big on giving grants to archeologists to prove that the
native Americans are really the lost tribe of Israel and other such
bunk.  The archeologists would shake their head knowingly while listening
to them, take the grant, and go off to do real archeology anyway.

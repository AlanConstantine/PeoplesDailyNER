I've just come from responding another of your posts, where some pennies
have dropped for me.  But it would clarify further if you would answer
from the point of view of any disinterested observers - perhaps an
observer as likely to be in position A as in position B (where A and B
disagree) in the future, and have his or her conclusion now binding on
them at that time.

Right. Why should I assert anything about beings that I don't believe in?
When I have no good idea of what this being is like, only some 
contradictory statements being made by various religions, I cannot 
firmly assert anything specific. 

A mathematical atheist has a proof that no godlike beings can exist.
However, we will first need a definition of 'god', and the theistic
religions do not agree very well on this. Did you see my earlier
posting on the existence of god? Theists cannot even agree whether
any god exists, or meta-exists, or is herself the existence. 
Omnipotence, omnibenevolence and omniscience are other concepts
theists do not all agree upon. Thus, it is hard to assert anything
about a such fluxional beings. _Deus absconditus_ remains hidden,
from those who believe and from those who don't.

I have to disagree here - first, philosophical maxims are not necessarily
something to build upon. What can I build upon Occam's Razor, for 
instance? Weak atheism is not a _philosophy_ (a philosophical system).
There are several alternatives from which atheists may choose from,
ranging from reductionism (my choice) to objectivism. Actually,
philosophy becomes simpler without the additional assumption of god/s.

Second, your claim that being without assertions is an Achilles'
heel of weak atheism sounds strange to me, and is actually a version
of the oft-heard theistic claim that 'but even atheists have to place their
faith on _something_, even if it is not god_'. This has been discussed in
the FAQ, but from a different viewpoint, and I do not repeat it.

I think one does not have to take _anything_ on blind faith.
True, one cannot prove that reality exists independent of the observer;
to assume this is not a blind leap of faith at all, however. It is
probably the simplest assumption one can make (after solipsism,
of course).

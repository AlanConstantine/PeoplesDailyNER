"Isaac Asimov read creationist books.  He read the Bible.  He had ample
opportunity to kneel before his Creator and Savior.  He refused.  In
fact, he sent out a strong promotional letter urging support of the
American Humanist Association, shortly before he died."

   --excerpt from Ken Ham, "Asimov Meets His Creator," _Back to Genesis_
     No. 42, June 1992, p. c (included in _Acts & Facts_ vol. 21, no. 6,
     June 1992, from the Institute for Creation Research).  This is one
     of the most offensive articles they've ever published--but at least
     it argues *against* a deathbed conversion.  There's a part of the
     article even worse than what I've just quoted, in which an excerpt
     from a reader's letter says that if Asimov is burning in hell now,
     "then he certainly has had a 180-degree change in his former beliefs
     about creation and the Creator."  (A post-deathbed conversion.)

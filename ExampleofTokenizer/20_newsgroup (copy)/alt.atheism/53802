SO?
What's your point?

MAYBE TO ME! (In this example, and as I argue below, that's not even
true.)

Not necessarily.

But science is also good for technology, which may or may not
have anything to do with truth. I may value technology and
not truth, after all.

Spare me. This is nonsense, Frank. Pregnancy is sometimes referred
to as having a "bun in the oven." Does this mean that the uterus
is at 450 F? Argument by idiom is weak indeed, and it's what
you're engaging in here.

Of course it's different. $3!=ma. What is at issue is accuracy,
not difference.

This is the result of a chain of deduction about the value
of understanding the universe. One can make the observation
that IF one wanted to understand the universe, F=ma would be
valuable without believing F=ma to be valuable, Frank.

>I'm valuing it, whether implicitly or

Things which have a basis in reality are different from things
which have a basis in reality. Quantum mechanics is very different
from biochemistry, yet they both (allegedly) have basises in reality.
Look, Frank, noone said that people didn't do science because they
value it(in the sense of think it is good), but that is not necessary
to make the observation that it's results have value (in the sense
that they are accurate.) Allow me to give you an example: I think
that knowing the byte order on IBM 3090s is pretty much worthless
(I don't care to know it) but I would be quite prepared to
note as valuable (i.e. accurate) the claim that it was Big-endian
if it was shown to be so (like, by showing me the manual.)

No, it's fleeking not. Scientific judgement is SOLELY the sense
of evaluating an expression (accuracy). It has nothing to do with
importance, worthiness, or usefulness. Choice of problems DOES
have to do with those factors, but they are orthogonal to
evaluating (for accuracy) solutions to chosen problems.

No, I was saying that it works independently of whether I measure
it, which is something quite different.

It would if they were the same thing, which they are not.

Frank, you are attempting to inject "goodness" judgements where there
are only "accuracy" judgements, by essentially punning on the word
'value' which has both meanings. "useful" is a goodness judgement.
"Reasonable" is an accuracy judgement. They are not the same
thing at all. ("Useful in making some conclusion" is an accuracy
judgement again, I'm afraid.) Sorry, Frank, but all you're doing is
using the ambiguity of English to obfuscate the issue. IF you
mean to say that science is based on value (accuracy) judgements,
I have no problem with that. If you mean to say that it's based
on value (goodness) judgements, that's nonsense. By contrast,
morality is clearly based on goodness judgements.

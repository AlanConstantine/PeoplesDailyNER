I have read it.  Conspicuous by its absence is any evidence or point.

The onus of proof is on you, sunshine.  What makes you think that
theist leaders believe what they say?  Especially when they say
one thing and do another, or say one thing closely followed by its
opposite?  The practice is not restricted to theism, but it's there
for anyone to see.  It's almost an epidemic in this country.

Just for instance, if it is harder for a camel to pass thru' the eye
of a needle, why is the Catholic church such a wealthy land-owner?  Why
are there churches to the square inch in my country?

Truth by blatant assertion.

Of course, other people are always fanatics, never oneself.  Your
wish to slur all theists seems pretty fanatical to me.

So?  You can do it.

Truth by blatant assertion.  I've seen as many bogus proofs of the 
non-existence of gods as I have of their existence.

I'd like to see this alleged evidence.

I see.  You have no irrational beliefs.  But then, fanatics never do, do
they?

Ergo, nothing is objective.  Fair enough.

Nope, it's not a fallacy.   It just doesn't go to the correlation you
wish to see.

A god is neither the easiest way to excuse anything, nor the only way.

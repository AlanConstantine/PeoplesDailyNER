Ah! Excellent. So why doesn't she appear to me? I'm a little weak in the
blind faith department. (Besides, she doesn't even really need to appear:
how about, oh say, a little tip - something like "put your all on #3 in the
7:30 at the Dog Races" ... perhaps in a dream or vision.)

I'm afraid I don't know arabic; I have only read translations. I wouldn't
know it if it were well-written. (Consistent, though, is one thing the Quran
is not.)  And have *you* read it in arabic?  Besides, some of my best
writing has been done under the influence of, shall we say, consciousness
altering substances.

Yes, so? How do we know they *weren't* very good? (Again, assuming that the
Quran is beautfully written.)

Ok, I retract this point. (Although I might still say that once he knew, he
should have done something about it.)

I haven't interviewed all muslims about this; I would really like it if this
were false. But I can't take it on your say-so - what are your sources?

What other basis do we have to judge a system? Especially when we can't get
a consistent picture of what Islam "really" is. Do I believe Khomeini? Do I
go by the Imam of the mosque in Mecca? Or perhaps the guy in New Jersey? Or
perhaps you say I should go only by the Quran. Ok, whose translation? And
what about things like "And wherever you find idolators, kill them"?

Well I agree with you in the sense that they have no "moral" right to inflict
these rules, but there is one thing I might add: at the very least, almost
everybody wants to avoid pain, and if that means sacrificing some stuff for a
herd morality, then so be it.

Right, and since they grew up and learned around us, they have some idea of our
right and wrong, which I think must, in part, be incorporated.  Very rarely do
you see criminal behaviour for "philosophical reasons"

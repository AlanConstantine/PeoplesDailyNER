False.  (Not (stating (X))) is not equivalent to (stating (not (x))).

There is no objective way of measuring the `goodness' of a moral
system.  It's a value judgement.  Therefore there is so objective
comparison for moral systems.  Therefore there is no `best' moral
system.

Similarly, there is no frame of reference that can be used to
objectively compare frames of reference.  Any such choice is
arbitrary.

Which is NOT to say that one should not take up reference frames for
various purposes.

There is nothing to believe -- not even this statement.

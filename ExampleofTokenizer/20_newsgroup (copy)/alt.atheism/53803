On a similar note, a good friend of mine worked as a clerk in a
chain bookstore.  Several of his peers were amazing, one woman in
particular:

A customer asked her if they had _The Autobiography of Benjamin
Franklin_.  "Who's it by?" was her first question.  Then, "Is he
still alive?"  Then, "Is it fiction or non-fiction?" 

Finally my friend intervened, and showed the guy where it was.
 
It makes one wonder what the standards of employment are.

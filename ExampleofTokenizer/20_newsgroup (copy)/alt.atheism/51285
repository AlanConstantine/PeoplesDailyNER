	You and Mr. bobby really need to sit down and decide what
exactly Islam  *is* before posting here.

	According to 'Zlumber, one is NOT a muslim when one is doing evil. 
[ A muslin can do no evil ] According to him, one who does evil is suffering 
from "temporary athiesm."

	Now, would the members who claim to be "Muslims" get their stories 
straight????

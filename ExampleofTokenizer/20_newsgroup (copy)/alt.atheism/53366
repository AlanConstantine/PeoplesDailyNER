Sorry for using a follow-up to respond, but my server dropped about a weeks worth of news
when it couldn't keep up.

When the you are asked to swear "So help you god" and you have to say it, ask which one; Jesus,
Allah, Vishnu, Zues, Odin.  Get them to be specific.   Don't be obnoxious, just humbly ask, then 
quitely sit back and watch the fun.

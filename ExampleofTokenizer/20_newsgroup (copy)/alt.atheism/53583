What I mean is what I said.   "What I want" does not automatically
translate into "what I think is right."   That is, it does not 
translate that way for me.

If you reply that "I think it is ok to kill you because that is what 
I decided" then what that means is that for you "What I want" does
translate into "what I think is right".

It just doesn't translate that way for me.

hold on there: no meaning to "consciousness" or "mind" or "self"?!

what illogicality?

since when is, for instance, (non-behaviourist) psychology a pipe dream? 
Surely the major purpose of the science of psychology is to understand the
workings of the mind.

"matter", "energy", "space" and "time" are well measured but mysterious

If some society came up with a good reason for why rape and murder are ok I 
would be consistent with my position and hold that it was still wrong.  My 
basis of morality is not on societal norms, or on current legalities.  My basis
is, surprise surprise, on both the Bible and on inherent moral abhorrences, for
lack of a better way to put it, to certain things.  Yes, that's vague, and the
only way I know off the top of my head to defend it is to say that all humans 
are similarly made. Yes, that falls into the trap of creation, and why follow 
the Bible.  My arguments are that it is better to exhibit trust, goodness, 
love, respect, courage, and honesty in any society rather than deceipt, hatred,
disrespect, "cowardness", and dishonesty.  No, I haven't been everywhere and 
seen everyone, but, according to my thesis, I don't have to, since I hold that
we were all created similarly.  If that makes an unfalsifiable thesis, just say
so, and I'll both work out what I can and punt to fellow theists.

With new taxes and spending cuts we'll still have 310 billion dollar deficits.

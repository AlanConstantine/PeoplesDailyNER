To all a.a readers:
     I have been asked be several of you to post a list of the SDA Church's 
27 Fundamental beliefs.  I warn you now, it's a long list.  However, I'll 
post it on Sunday.  Sabbath is coming up soon so I won't be reading on 
Saturday.  And I don't have time to do it now.
     I would GREATLY appreciate it if you would keep me in touch with what's 
going on.
     I hope all of you have a reastful and relaxing weekend.  I hope it's 
the best one so far!!

Tammy

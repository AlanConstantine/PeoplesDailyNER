But once you make a decision on the value of truth, and the likelihood of 
science getting it, the rest follows.  In your example, science is necessarily
worthless, and so are its results, because truth is worthless, assuming that's
all science is good for.  And it's no accident that phrases such as "good
for" fit so naturally in this context.

#value in the first sense, but not the second.

But I don't use it in the second sense.  Consider that F=ma is no 
different than F=$3 until I note the connection with reality that F=ma has, and
F=$3 does not.  I'm making a decision as to the importance of F=ma
over other expressions I can compute.  I'm valuing it, whether implicitly or
directly, because I'm saying that things that have a basis in reality
are different to other things which do not.  And _no-one_ points
out an _unimportant_ difference, _except_ to say that it's unimportant.
"Important", "useful", "worthy", etc. are all words with evaluative
power, quite different from evaluating an expression.  I'm careful
to use "value" in the sense I mean, which is invariably the first.

#Huh? What are you talking about? People frequently point out the

O.K., I misunderstood.  I thought you meant observed in the sense
of 'not-quite-sure-observations', by which I mean those undertaken
by people.

Yes it does.  You're saying in effect "it works independently of what I
believe", and basing that statement on your "reasonable assumption" (i.e. 
unsupported belief) that it works indepently of what you believe. It
begs the question rather obviously.  And of course, "reasonable
assumption" seems to be weasel words for "seems useful", "useful"
belonging to world of ghosts and values, and therefore being unreal.

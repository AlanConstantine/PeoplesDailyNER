Thanks Jon.  I had forgotten about the 1912 and 1927 invasions (if I had
ever learned of them.  I mean I *really* forgot!)  But I read the context
as more recent, such as when the Sandinistas were expecting an "imminent"
invasion from the U.S. which never happened.

I stand corrected.  Thanks.

I remembered this one.  This one and Bush's invasion were the two I
mentioned above.  Good ol' Teddy R.-- he knew how to get things done!

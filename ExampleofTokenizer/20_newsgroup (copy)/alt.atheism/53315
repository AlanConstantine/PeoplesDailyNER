I guess I'm delving into a religious language area.  What exactly is morality 
or morals?  I never thought of eating meat to be moral or immoral, but I think
it could be.  How do we differentiate between not doing something because it is
a personal choice or preference and not doing something because we see it as 
immoral?  Do we fall to what the basis of these morals are?

Also, consensus positions fall to a might makes right.  Or, as you brought out,
if whatever is right is what is societally mandated then whoever is in control
at the time makes what is right

Just like history is written by the `winners' and not the `losers.'
From what I've seen of religions, a religion is just a cult that
was so vile and corrupt it was able to exert it's doctrine using
political and military measures.  Perhaps if Koresh withstood the
onslaught for another couple of months he would have started 
attracting more converts due to his `strength,' hence becoming a
full religion and not just a cult.

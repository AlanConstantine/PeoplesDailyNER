	One need not have have the notion that science is useful. For 
example: many Christian scientists do not believe medical science to be 
usefor or worthy. That does not make medical science subjective.

	In any event, I fail to see what you mean by "subjective" science.
Are you suggesting that it is, and that if I step of a building, I may fall, 
while you may not?

	I assure you, it is a very objective conclusion that you will fall 
( without any other outside means of support ). If you do not believe this, 
I suggest you step off of a building, and subjectively believe that you will 
not fall.

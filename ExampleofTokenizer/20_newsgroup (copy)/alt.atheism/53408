For example, I would claim that the recent assassination of four
catholic construction workers who had no connection with the IRA
was probably religously motivated.

What would you call is when someone writes "The killings in N.I 
are not religously motivated?"

Given that the avowed aim of the IRA is to take Northern Ireland
into a country that has a particular church written into its 
constitution, and which has restriction on civil rights dictated
by that Church, I fail to see why the word "past" is appropriate.

You don't have to hand us a bunch of double-talk about what
I was "seemingly" attacking.   I *quoted* what I was attacking.

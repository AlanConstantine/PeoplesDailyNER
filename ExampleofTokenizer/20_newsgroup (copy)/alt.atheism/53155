    We are talking about origins, not merely science.   Science cannot
    explain origins.  For a person to exclude anything but science from
    the issue of origins is to say that there is no higher truth
    than science.  This is a false premise.  By the way, I enjoy science.
    It is truly a wonder observing God's creation.  Macroevolution is
    a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent religion [guaranteed
    within three percent error :) ]

If you force me to do something, am I morally responsible for it?

Well, make up your mind.    Is it to be "instinctive not to murder"
or not?

It's not even correct.    Animals of the same species do kill
one another.

Sigh.   I wonder how many times we have been round this loop.

I think that instinctive bahaviour has no moral significance.
I am quite prepared to believe that higher animals, such as
primates, have the beginnings of a moral sense, since they seem
to exhibit self-awareness.

So what?     Are you trying to say that some killing in animals
has a moral significance and some does not?   Is this your
natural morality>

Are you blind?   What do you think that this sentence means?

	"There must be the possibility that the organism - it's not 
	just people we are talking about - can consider alternatives."

What would that imply?

I find the fact that they do to be significant.

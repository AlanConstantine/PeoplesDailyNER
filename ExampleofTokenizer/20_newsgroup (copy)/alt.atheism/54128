  Speaking of proofs of God, the funniest one I have ever seen was in a
  term paper handed in by a freshman.  She wrote, "God must exist, because
  he wouldn't be so mean as to make me believe he exists if he really
  doesn't!"  Is this argument really so much worse than the ontological
  proofs of the existence of God provided by Anselm and Descartes, among
  others?

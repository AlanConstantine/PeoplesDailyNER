I think many reading this group would also benefit by knowing how
deviant the view _as I've articulated it above_ (which may not be
the true view of Khomeini) is from the basic principles of Islam. 
So that the non-muslim readers of this group will see how far from 
the simple basics of Islam such views are on the face of them. And 
if they are _not_ in contradiction with the basics of Islam, how 
subtle such issues are and how it seems sects exist in Islam while 
they are explicitly proscribed by the Qur'an.

In my opinion considering any human being as having a substance
or metaphysical fundamentally different from that of any other human
being _is_ a heretical notion and one proscribed by Islam.

Absolutely! I would be interested in discussing this privately and
I am interested in hearing how one might try to make the concept of
error-free and sinless human beings philosophically consistent with
the teachings of the Qur'an. However, _prima facie_ such attemptsa
are highly susceptible to degenerating into monkery, explicitly
proscribed by the Qur'an.

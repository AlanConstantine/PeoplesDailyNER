I believe that the idea of objective morality is absurd, becasuse all
the evidence I've seen indicates that morality and moral systems are
man made and thus subjective.

This is not a shot at Christianity; I would apply it to any other person
or group that advocates objective morality, unless said person/group
can provide some sort of evidence to support that claim.

Actually, Christians do claim an absolute morality, but that is another
matter.

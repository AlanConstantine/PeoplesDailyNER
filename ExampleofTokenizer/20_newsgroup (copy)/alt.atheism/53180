So, we should ban the ammunition?  Why not get rid of the guns?

It is worse than others?  The National Anthem?  Should it be changed too?
God Bless America?  The list goes on...

Then you'd be no better than the people you despise.

Oh?

An endorsement, or an acknowledgement?  I think gods are things that people
are proud of, but I don't think the motto encourages belief.

Is it?

[...]

Would you approve of such a motto?

And removing the tool will solve the problem?

Or will it increase the problem?

I think it may also be worthwhile pointing out that if we
take the appellation `Rabbi' seriously then Jesus had a full
grasp of contemporary `scripture'

Mat21:42 Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures...

Mat22:29 Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing
Mat22:29 the scriptures, nor the power of God.

Following from this, he would have been in a wonderful
position to fulfil prophesies, and the NT says as much:

Mat26:54 But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled,
Mat26:54 that thus it must be?

Mat26:56 But all this was done, that the scriptures of the
Mat26:56 prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples
Mat26:56 forsook him, and fled.

If the books comprising the referred-to `scripture' had not
been accessible then it probably would be a different
matter.

Are you confusing Bhagwan Rajneesh (sp?) with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi
here by any chance?  I think Bhagwan was in Oregon with all the Rolls
Royces.  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi founded Transcendental Meditation and
does the yogic flying stuff.  Bhagwan's group was a communal, free sex
kind of thing.  I think they both had beards, though.

Brian, does all this mean that you have to be well versed in ancient
Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic in order to understand the core of
Christianity? I hope you are not Catholic, because my Christian
upbringing was based on the teachings of Luther, and the one of
the core messages was basically that you don't need to know latin
in order to learn about salvation.

BTW, your statement would also eliminate about 99.5% of all the Christians
in the world, as well.

Cheers,
Kent

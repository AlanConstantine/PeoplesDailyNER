I don't think anyone really cares about the solid structure of his
sermon.  It's the deaths he's responsible for that concern most people.

Charles Manson used revelation as well.  Do we see a pattern here?

Koresh was a nut, okay?  Just because he found ways for the Bible
to backup his rantings does not make him any less of a kook.

I'll type this very slowly so that you can understand.  He either set
the fire himself or told his followers to do so.  Don't make him out to
be a martyr.  He did not "get killed", he killed himself.

The evil was inside the compound.  All that "thou shalt not kill" stuff.

Give me a break!  What fireman should have to deal with a blaze like that
AND get shot at at the same time.

These people were breaking the law.  I agree these weren't the best tactics,
they probably should have backed off, pulled the perimeter way back, and let
them sit there with no media attention until they decided to come out.  The 
only other alternative I see would have been to send in a couple of special
forces guys to capture or assassinate Koresh.  But remember, these fruit-
loops were putting their lives on the lines voluntarily.  Why should 
law-abiding citizens have to put themselves in any more danger than necessary
when dealing with a nut?  Look at the man who jumped out of his Bradley to
grab a flaming women who was running back into the building.  Yeah, I would
have to say they were trying to save those people.  I don't think I would 
risk my life that much to save someone that stupid that obviously didn't
even want to be saved.

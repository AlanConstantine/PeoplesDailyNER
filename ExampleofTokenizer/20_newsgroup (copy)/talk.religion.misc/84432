When the right to freedom of speech was "invented", all we had to worry about
was printing presses and live speech. Now, we have to worry about violent movies
influencing the young and tv beaming pornography into homes. Do you really believe we should start restricting constitutionally guaranteed freedoms because
the technology has changed? Freedom is ageless. It was a good idea then and it
still is.

Be real careful when second guessing the founding fathers.

Actually, after surviving being driven out of Nauvoo, and later Carthage,
the Mormons DID fortify Utah.  They still arm themselves to "defend the
faith", and stockpile food as well.  They have been involved in quite a
lot of illegal activity - including multiple (and often underage) wives
for the leaders - a practice still in vogue with some splinters of their
sect.  The parallels between Koresh and Joseph Smith are striking.

So what did the Mormons get?  It seems that J. Edgar Hoover was very
impressed with the way they kept secrets.  (They're pledged to defend
secrets with their lives and atone for sin with blood.  Many actually
do - even to the point of suicide.)  So he hired virtually no one but
Mormons, until the FBI was almost exclusively staffed by members of the
Church of Later Day Saints.  Though J. Edgar is finally gone, the FBI
personnel (especially the field agents) are still heavily Mormon.

I have often wondered how this might affect the FBI's treatment
of religious organizations a Mormon would consider heretical.

Hoover was for many years up near the top of my hate list.  And I hold no 
brief for the FBI.  But where does this notion come from that Hoover made 
special efforts to recruit LDS members?  And is there credible evidence for 
the assertion that they are "pledged to defend secrets with their lives and 
atone for sin with blood"?  I've known only a few Mormons; but none of them 
seemed to me to fit this description.  Sounds to me reminiscent of the Jewish- 
and Masonic-conspiracy theories of blessed memory.

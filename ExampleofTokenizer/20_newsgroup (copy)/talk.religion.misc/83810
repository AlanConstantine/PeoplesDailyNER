Suppose you had the option to specify that your tax money can't pay for
abortions.  Do you think that that should entitle you to pay *less* taxes?
Since refusing to fund abortions would lead to an even larger increase in
funding for pre-natal care and delivery, if anything you should pay *more*
taxes.  Suppose we let your taxes stay at the same level.

Do you really think that funding for abortion would be reduced?  No, your
taxes would go towards other things, and more taxes from those who don't
object to paying for abortion would be moved from those other things to
pay for abortions.  All that happens is that the funds get shuffled around,
to give you a clear conscience.  Why put the government through all that
paperwork when the end result is no different?  Why worry about it when
it makes no difference and it doesn't hurt you in the least.

That is the most rediculous out-of-context analogy I have every heard.  I
do not advocate any such "advice".  There is quite a difference between
the illegal violation called "rape", and the constitutionally granted power
of taxation along with the funding of legal procedures.  If you can't see
the difference you can go to hell.

Your yanking followups to posts of mine (from other threads?) does not
demonstrate any deliberate lack of response on my part.  There is a great
deal of bandwidth on talk.abortion, and it can take a long time to get
through to the followups to articles I have posted, and many times responses
expire before I get to reading them.

It is pretty fucking arrogant of you to pull copies here and demand that
I respond to them here when they were posted already and quite possibly
responded to separately.  I believe I *have* indeed responded to some of
the following previously--though probably not each of them.

By the way, thanks *so* much for deleting the context of this next line in

I have done so in the past.  It isn't my fault that you never saw it.

Here is a *brief* explanation.

A person has a right to do anything that does not interfere with the rights
of another person.  If you want to hear more about this aspect of "personity"
go read the thread "Why is bodily autonomy so important?" on talk.abortion.
You may have to look at all unexpired posts on that thread to find the post
where I give a fairly detailed explanation.  I believe it was posted on
April 18 or 19.

The second part is a definition of a person.  A simplistic explanation is
that a "person" is a member of society.  Most normal adult human beings are
good examples of "people".  Most children over two years old are "people" as
well.  The simple way of determining this is that you can have a conversation
with them.  It is actually more complicated than that, but I have no desire
to spend the time it would take to explain it to you.  Read the thread "Why
is bodily autonomy so important?" for more explanation and justification.

Actually, I was refering to the minority that objects to abortion, not
those who object to federal funding.  I admit I did not say it very
clearly, and apologize for that.

Do you have statistics that might answer this question?  Or are you just
blowing smoke.

I said what I said.  If you had not deleted most of it, everyone could
see for themselves what I said.

>Are we simply to take it on your authority that there is "no reason"?

If you disagree then give us some "reasons".  Given that abortion is
*LEGAL* and the right to abortion is supported by the majority of the
population (or can you provide unbiased statistics?  I doubt you can
because I have never heard of an unbiased poll that has been conducted.)
...it is not justifiable to refuse abortions to women who can not afford
them, who will simply require even greater funds for the delivery you
would force upon them.  I refuse to pay *more taxes* to remove choice
from those women just because you object to a legal medical procedure.

More guns in society does not reduce the burden on the police;
it increases it.

Now this is rediculous.  Public transportation puts less of a burden on
transportation routes (roads, rails, etc) than private transportation.
It also puts a lesser burden on the environment.

Oh this makes sense.  Ever hear of "welfare"?  Know what it's all about?

Not "infants" you idiot.  Infants are born.

Who has a "right to life"?  People who have not violated other's rights,
have a "right to life".  A fetus is not a person.  You can not have a
conversation with them.  They are not biologically independent.  Their
awareness is questionable.  They have no experiences in the "real world"
to make up a personality.

Ever hear of "euthanasia"?  Ever hear of insurance companies refusing to
fund potentially life-saving treatment because they don't feel there is
sufficient evidence that it will work to be worth the expense?  Which one
gets you angrier?  Why is that?

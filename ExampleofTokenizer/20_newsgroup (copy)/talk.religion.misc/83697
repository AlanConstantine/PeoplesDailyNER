	   One thing that should be made clear is that neither the FBI nor

Sigh, I was waiting some some not-so-intelligent person to bring this
up.  Look, this is a country of laws. To quote a piece of parchment
that many seem to think is of little importance:

 4th Amendment
 The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, 
 papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, 
 shall not be violated; and no warrants shall issue, but upon 
 probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and 
 particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons 
 or things to be seized. 

No, a no-knock warrant is in clear violation of the 4th amendment.
Okay, what about the fact that they were tipped off - they shouldn't
have opened fire - right?  WRONG!  Think about this: I am a drug
dealer and my competition wants to do away with me. They call me and
tell me that the Feds are on their way with a no-knock warrant. So,
being moronic sheep we wait, with our guns holstered. Now, instead of
the Feds, in comes my competition, and we're history.  The only
acceptable answer to a no-knock warrant is blazing guns!  I may sound
paranoid, but our government is out of control, and killing a few
federal officers make knock some sense back into it.

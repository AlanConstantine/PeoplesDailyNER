     I wasn't sure if this was the right newsgroup to post this to, but I guess
the misc is there for a reason.  Here goes...  I am getting married in June to 
a devout (Wisconsin Synod) Lutheran.  I would classify myself as a strong 
agnostic/weak athiest.  This has been a a subject of many discussions between
us and is really our only real obstacle.  We don't have any real difficulties 
with the religious differences yet, but I expect they will pop up when we have 
children.  I have agreed to raise the
children "nominally" Lutheran.  That is, Lutheran traditions, but trying to
keep an open mind.  I am not sure if this is even possible though.  I feel that
that the worst quality of being devoutly religous is the lack of an open mind.

     Anyway, I guess I'll get on with my question.  Is anyone in the same 
situation and can give some suggestions as to how to deal with this?  We've 
taken the attitude so far of just talking about it a lot and not letting 
anything get bottled up inside.  Sometimes I get the feeling we're making this 
much bigger than it actually is.  Any comments would be greatly appreciated.  
Also, please e-mail responses since I don't get a chance to read this group
often.  :-(

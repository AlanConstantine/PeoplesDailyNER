It is significant to remember that these secular positions were held by
"average" people, and that at the time, almost all Americans were pretty
homogeonously Christian.  It was largely the mainstream Christian's disgust
at such practices as polygamy which resulted in their irrational hatred.

The situation is not entirely different today.  Many irrational feelings and
beliefs are justified through religion.  I don't think most of them are started
because of religion, but religion certainly helps justify and perpetuate
prejudices and practices by providing a neat justification which discourages
critical thought.

Do you mean that the "secular authorities" are some continuous group of
people with the common and uninterrupted goal of harrassing/eradicating the
Mormons?  Do you honestly believe that the main reason for using Utah for
nuclear testing etc.. was to "get them thar Mormons"?  And what about the
majority of Uthan's who aren't Mormons?  You seem to be searching for enemy
conspiracies.  It is paranoid to believe that everything that affects you badly
must have been done primarily for that purpose.

I personally feel that we should try to stop anyone who is a threat to the
life of even one person.  Sure, he did not pose a threat to the security of
this nation.  But he did pose a threat to the lives of his followers.  That
much is definite.

This is like asking who REALLY caused the deaths of the Israeli Olympic
team in 1976?  In that case, the police botched the job as well.  But to
lay a heavier burden on them than the terrorists would be a terrible mistake.
I think the same sort of reasoning applies in this case.  Certainly, if David
Koresh chose any peaceful option, the ATF and FBI would have complied.  The
responsibility is more his than the authorities.

>David Koresh, no doubt, will be described as the "evil" guy (by the

Characterizing the ATF/FBI as executioners is inaccurate and unfair.  In order
to be an executioner, the least one must have done is have the intent to kill.

I don't necessarily agree with Pat Robertson.  Every one will be placed before
the judgement seat eventually and judged on what we have done or failed to do
on this earth.  God allows people to choose who and what they want to worship.
Worship of money is one of the greatest religions in this country.

I do agree that it was a terrible tragedy and, yes, the FBI blew it.

Cult status, maybe, but they didn't have to take up arms to protect themselves.
As you may recall, the early Christians were pacifists preferring to avoid
physical confrontation rather than dealing with it in like manner.  Why else
do you think the apostles were thrown into jail so often and beaten up for the
sake of their beliefs?

Self-fulfilled.  I heard that Koresh was predicting that the FBI would be the
ones to burn.  It doesn't take any great insight to light yourself on fire, maybe
perverse delusion.

NOT!  He was an egomaniac who had the attention of the entire world for a brief
moment in time.  Rather than live with the shame of being taken captive by the
FBI, Koresh chose to kill himself and his followers.  Sick and . . . sad.

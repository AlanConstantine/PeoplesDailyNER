	This will not, of course, deter the several die-hard Koreshies on
this net, who will probably claim that the Tarrant County medical examiner
(Dr. Peerwani) was coerced by the FBI into faking this evidence.  Either that,
or they'll claim the FBI shot them.
	The rest of us might contemplate the difficulty of determining the
cause of death from a corpse that has been reduced to a Krispy Kritter.

There are "basic services" and there are "optional services", Dennis. Call 
waiting is an optional service, but having the number "3" work on one's phone
is a basic service. Just because some nutcase doesn't happen to use the "3"
on his phone, since none of the numbers he calls has a "3" in it, doesn't mean 
that he has the right to demand that the phone company "unbundle" the charges
for the use of each phone digit; an unbundling that would be horrendously
inefficient because of all the billing & bookkeeping overhead. Similarly, 
abortion can be seen as a "basic service".

Furthermore, public funding of abortion SAVES money, as well as being, in the 
views of a substantial portion of the population, probably a clear majority, 
an ethical thing to do. If you don't like saving money on your taxes in that 
way, why don't you take the taxes you save and invest in private charities 
with programs that help reduce the NEED for abortion. If every pro-lifer did 
the same, it would create a massive economic negative feedback loop which 
would all but ELIMINATE the need for public funding of abortion. Then you 
would get your wish. And, you know what? No pro-choicer I know would stop
you carrying out that plan. They might even HELP you with it...

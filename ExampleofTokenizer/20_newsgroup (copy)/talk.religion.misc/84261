So, it's _sometimes_ correct to say that morality is objective, or what?
After all, I could hardly be wrong, without dragging in the o-word.
For your part, when you say that relativism is true, that's just
your opinion.  Why do folk get so heated then, if a belief in relativism
is merely a matter of taste?  (to be fair, _you_ have been very calm,
I get the impression that's because you don't care about notions of
objectivity in any flavour.  Right?)

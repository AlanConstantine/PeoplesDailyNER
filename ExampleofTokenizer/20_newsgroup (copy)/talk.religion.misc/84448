And maybe they do.  But without somebody to set the time that doesn't
do them any good.

Humph.  Deleted there was my list of non-religious reasons one might
want a moment of silence for a dead classmate.

Maybe everyone doesn't want to be silent for teachers to give their
pompous non-religious speeches in assembly.  I know I didn't.  So?

Please provide documentation that opposing only things that are
actively religious (e.g. actual prayer, "Amen" after a moment of
silence, mandatory classes in religion) and not things that have
possible but uncertain religious implications (e.g. moments of
silence, having the Bible on the shelves during reading period) is not
a way to prevent a state religion.

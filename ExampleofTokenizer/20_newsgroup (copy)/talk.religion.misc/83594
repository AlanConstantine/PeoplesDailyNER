This was an open question.  I assumed that if Mr. Archer is a chronic
liar, someone whould have documented it.   This assumption is based on
how talk.origins regulars have documented numerous cases of Creationist
deceptions (such as Duane Guish and his friends).

No long list of Archer mistakes has yet been given, so this may be just
an isolated incident...

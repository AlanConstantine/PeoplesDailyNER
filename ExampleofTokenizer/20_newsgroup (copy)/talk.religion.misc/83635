I think you are leaving out a great deal of other "value".  There is no
rational reason to give an "abortionist" a "value" 10 million times that
of a fetus.  (Why not 10 billion, for instance...oh, but then you would
loose on the deal.)

Instead we should look at what is *really* involved in each abortion.
There is the loss of a human life, a life that would otherwise have
eventually become a member of society.  That is certainly a non-zero
value.  There is the physical and emotional suffering of a woman who
finds herself with an unwanted pregnancy, and the greater suffering
caused by the refusal of society to allow her to deal with it.  That
woman is *already* a member of society.

I argue that the cost of suffering of a *real* member of society is
far greater than the loss of a *potential* future member of society.

Now, as for your "deal".  Suppose you "pay" the value of all the suffering
of every woman who *was* denied an abortion, or *would have been* denied
an abortion, under your desired position.  And "we" will "pay" the value
of all the potential future members of society that never became a part of
it (or *would* not have been a part of it, under *our* desired position).

Think about it.

Of course, I expect you will object to my argument that suffering of
on-going life is worse than loss of just-starting life.  If so, please
put forth some rational argument for how the life of a (currently)
non-sentient creature is somehow worth the suffering of a sentient being.
(I figure if I ask enough places, and such an arguement exists, I should
eventually see it.)

The point is that when we recognize these "instantiations" of mathematical
systems, we do so because we VALUE being able to describe and perhaps even 
to control these instantiations. There is always a driving purpose behind
thought -- a motive, if you will. Sometimes that motive is relatively 
"pure", e.g. pursuit of knowledge, othertimes it's "impure", e.g. pursuit
of money, or of physical pleasure. But it's always there. And even when it
is a "pure" pursuit of knowledge, presumably one pursues knowledge in order
to personally grow, develop, advance to a higher plane of being. So there
is still an element of acquisition, of reaching, of grasping, even in the
approach of the "detached, objective" scientist.

No, I think you are the one who is rather confused. There are two senses
in which we can say that the phenomenon of "the working of the DES chip" is 
value-based:

	1) Because there is bound to be some reason why we built the DES
	   chip and started it running in the first place

		and

	2) Because the very notion/definition/concept of "works" has value
	   associated with it

The first is a CAUSAL linkage -- we want it to work, therefore we CAUSE it to 
work. That is rather a mundane interpretation. The second, however, is a more 
subtle and deeper PHENOMENOLOGICAL linkage -- that the attribute "works" is 
itself, as everything else, presented to the human consciousness as a _valued_ 
fact, not just a fact-in-itself. You are perhaps justified in shooting down 
the causal linkage, but you have not begun to address the phenomenological 
linkage.

Our predictions or confirmations that suns shine in unpopulated solar systems
are, however, items of value.

Again, our predictions or confirmations of the working of genetic algorithms
are items of value.

The universe does not DEPEND on human values, no, but our experience and
understanding and concepts of the universe _are_ laced with human values.
Phenomenologically, everything is value-related, since the thing which is 
experiencing the phenomena, i.e. self, is itself value-driven. Self is, in 
fact, the very SOURCE of all values. Whatever involves self involves values.

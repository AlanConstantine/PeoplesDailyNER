No, Dave, and as an anthropologist I take great umbrage with this 
misrepresentation.  I sense that it is you that has made the jump from creation
(science) to religion (see above).  I have characterized science/*creation 
science* as rationalism/nonsense, and that it is.  When people promote their 
religious beliefs as science they become nonsense.  Kept where they belong 
they are meaningful and useful, as virtually any anthropologists will tell you,
and as I have said several times in this group.  And it works the other way, 
too, and I have repeatedly said so.  Never have I said or meant anything 
different, here or elsewhere, and I don't think my communication skills betray
me.  Nor do I presume to offend people's spiritual sensibilities, as
I would hope others would not disparage mine.

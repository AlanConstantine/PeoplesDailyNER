Not only are they not objective, but they don't even stay constant
over time.   A young farmer and an old farmer on the verge of 
retirement have quite different ideas about the relative values of 
a piece of land and a dollar bill.

Similarly, a person viewing an anonymous piece of land, and a 
person viewing a piece of land that his family has lived on for
generations.

These values are essentially subjective, and that's why we have
markets: to allow people to match their valuations of land and
dollar bills.

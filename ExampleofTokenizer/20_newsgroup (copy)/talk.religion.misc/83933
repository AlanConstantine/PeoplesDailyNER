How would someone named "Dennis" be stuck paying for "abortion
coverage" ... if abortion is put under a catagory of a "general
medical procedure."  You have to ask the insurer: "Would my policy
cover an abortion?" to find out.  If it does, you should have a
right to decline that "coverage" if YOU DON'T WANT IT.

The basic premise in private insurance is that you pay for the
coverage YOU WANT.  If basically you want "catastrophic coverage"
you get a policy with a high deductible (with a correspondingly
LOWER premium).  Similarly, you don't have to be COMPELLED to
take on a policy covering things like liposuction or hair
transplantation, if you DON'T WANT THAT KIND OF COVERAGE, again,
at a corresponding savings to you.

If you don't want to be "covered" for abortion, you should not be
COMPELLED to.  To millions of Christians, abortion is not a
"gynocological examination" or a "pap smear."  To them abortion
is murder.  To them, being "covered for abortion" means that they
are paying for a "service," which THEY THINK IS EVIL, CLEARLY
DON'T WANT, and will NEVER USE.  In such a case, all that is
happening is that they are being COMPELLED to help pay for OTHER
PEOPLE'S abortions.

When you are being forced to BUY something you DON'T WANT and
will NEVER USE, this is called extortion.

When the mafia tells a restaurant owner to "buy" a "juke-box" for
the owner's "protection" this is called racketeering. 

And if one's access to health care is held hostage to signing a
defacto "loyalty oath" in support of abortion, by promising to
help pay for other people's abortions (when one is clearly
opposed to this procedure) this is tantamount to the same thing.

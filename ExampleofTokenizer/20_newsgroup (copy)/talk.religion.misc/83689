Dr. Tahir Ijaz comments on Esam Abdel-Rahem's statement:

>But the problem is We consider ourself to be Muslims, even though you don't.
>Luckily, faith is determined by what one believes and is a personal matter.
>You cannot declare the faith of someone else.


Mr. Jawad Ali then comments on Tahir Ijaz's statement:

The argument by Jawad Ali is funny, He writes:
"The converse would be that the problem is that Muslims dont consider
Ahmadies to be Muslims"

Which is a wrong statement. In the light of Dr. Ijaz's statement, the
above statement should be corrected:
".......................................is that (some) non-Ahmadi Muslims
don't consider Ahmadi-Muslims as Muslims"

So, the problem does not get solved:-) Who is a muslims and who is not?
Humans cannot decide. Humans may not declare others faiths. Its that 
simple. I don't understand, why the mere use of the word "ISLAM" is
becomming such a big issue. I have seen numorous postings on the net
on this subject, and all they say, "No, NO, you cannot use ISLAM as 
the name of your newsgroup". ?? 

I haven't seen a single posting stating what right do they have in declaring
the name of other's faiths? Who gives them this authority? Quran? or
Hadith? or something else? I want to know this! 

Just a small reminder to all my Muslim Brothers, Did _EVER_ the 
Holy Prophet of Islam (Muhammad PBUH), say to anyone who called
himself a Muslim:

No, You are not a Muslim ! ???????

NEVER! I challenge all my Muslim brothers to produce a single 
such evidence from the history of Islam!

Hence, if the Prophet Muhammad could never do that to anyone, how
could the Muslims, Mullahs or even Governments of today do
it to anyone. Do you consider yourself above the Holy Prophet 
Muhammad (PBUH) ?? 


Sincerely,
Nabeel.

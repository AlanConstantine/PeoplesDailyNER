(st)Seems to me Koresh is yet another messenger that got killed
(st)for the message he carried. (Which says nothing about the 

(km)Seems to be, barring evidence to the contrary, that Koresh was simply
(km)another deranged fanatic who thought it neccessary to take a whole bunch of
(km)folks with him, children and all, to satisfy his delusional mania. Jim
(km)Jones, circa 1993.

I think there's plenty of evidence to the contrary - six "rescued"
Davidians consistantly recounted that the Federal tank knocked over a barrel
of propane. These guys haven't exactly been spending time together,
plotting an elaborate and consistent story. It would be contradictory
for Koresh to go for "mass suicide" - remember that Koresh's death was
the opening of the sixth seal - the signal that Armageddon had begun.
His army (the people in the compound) would then fight the powers of
evil and win, ending in the Rapture. The fire wiped out his army. I
read earlier that Koresh was planning to walk out of the compound 
and blow himself up with a grenade - that would jibe better with
his teachings.

(st)In the mean time, we sure learned a lot about evil and corruption.
(st)Are you surprised things have gotten that rotten?

(km)Nope - fruitcakes like Koresh have been demonstrating such evil corruption
(km)for centuries.

I'd think you'd be the last one to support gassing people and 
burning them to death for their religious beliefs. Corrupt? Evil?
I don't know. We'll never know. And when you start calling people 
fruitcakes about their religious beliefs, that's dehumanizing people.
We saw what happened when many Germans started believing that Jews
were subhuman.

In one neat stroke, they destroyed all the evidence that could have 
pointed to wrongdoing. And killed all the witnesses, including 12
children whose last view of life was choking and pain, followed by
burning them alive.

I am extremely saddened that this tragedy occurred. I'm furious that
they used my money to do it.

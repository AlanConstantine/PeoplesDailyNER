-----------------------
evolution = theory
creation = fact
vs                        Is this demonstrating the nonsense part?
evolution = assertion     
creation = fiction

What is the fact of evolution?  There is a difference between calling evolution a
fact and talking about the theory of evolution providing facts (I happen to think
the latter is more accurate ).  And you said it best yourself: If you assess 
the _theories_ of evolution objectively...  Why didn't you say,  If you assess 
the _facts_ of evolution objectively...

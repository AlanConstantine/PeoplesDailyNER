I'm having trouble receiving News at the moment due to an overloaded
News server. I think that I can post out reasonably quickly, though.

I'm in a couple of threads at the moment which may be pending replies.
If anyone wants a reply from me over something I've posted then I
suggest sending an e-mail copy of the point to me so that I can reply by
News.

This is one way to shut me up!!

Cheers,

David.

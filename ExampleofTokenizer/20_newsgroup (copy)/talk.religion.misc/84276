Why don't you tell us, Tony?  I'm sure what you THINK you know adds up to a
lot more than what Casper has.

Doesn't it frustrate you to consider how many intelligent, thoughtful 
people you have prepared for the Mormon missionaries with your rant?  The
more you talk, the better we look.  Nothing makes the truth look better
than a background of falsehood.

Sic 'em, Tony!

And I "therefore would continue the argument that" [sic]:
	Menstruation == murder
	 and contraception == killing.  
After all, non-existence is less than life, so it's our duty to
bring all possible potential beings into existence, or at least
to try.

Men!  Have you had unprotected sex today with as many fertile
women as possible?  If not, why not?  Women!  Did you menstruate
without attempting to conceive this month?  You murderesses!

In Holtsingerian terms, a total ban on contraception is the
logical consequence of pro-life reasoning.

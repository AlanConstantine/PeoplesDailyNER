Here is someones "biblical" claim for the characteristics of Satan:

>This is probably the portion of Scripture that you were talking about, Isaiah 14:12-15.
>This does speak of the "morning star" which, according to you is the
>Babylonian prince.  OK, so I turn your attention to Daniel 10:12-14.  This passage
>concerns a revelation of prophecy to Daniel by the messenger from God.  Within
>this passage, the messenger from God speaks of how he fought for 3 weeks 
>against the Prince of the Persian Kingdom.  Obviously, this prince was not an earthly
>prince.  This prince of the Persian kingdom is probably one of the demons
>in Satan's hierarchy.  As such, the morning star can be the prince of Babylon w
>ho can also be Satan.  Another passage concerning Satan's fall from heaven is 
>Ezekiel 28:12-19.

And separately:

>devil chose to try to become greater than God.
>he wanted to sit on God's throne.
>when the devil was created, he was one of the most beautiful angels in heaven.

We have here three distinct claims concerning the results of the devil's
decision making, a specific desire, and a physical description.  Now, in
support (aside from the minor detail that an author seldom writes an unbiased
account of the opposition) we see:

>Isaiah 14:12-15

ISA 14:12  How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the
morning!  how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken
the nations!

ISA 14:13  For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend  into
                                              --------------------
heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit
-----------------------------------------------------
also upon the mount of the congregation,  in  the  sides  of the north:

ISA 14:14  I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I  will
be like the most High.

ISA 14:15  Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to  the  sides
of the pit.


Doesn't say sits on God's throne.  Says will exhault throne above the stars.

>Daniel 10:12-14

DAN 10:12  Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for  from the
first  day  that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to
chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard,  and  I am
come for thy words.

DAN 10:13  But the prince of the kingdom of Persia  withstood me
                    ------------------------------
one  and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes,
                                        ------------------------
came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.

DAN 10:14  Now I am come to make thee understand what  shall be-
fall  thy  people  in  the latter days: for yet the vision is for
many days.


See who is being discussed?


>Ezekiel 28:12-19

EZE 28:12  Son of man, take up a lamentation  upon  the  king of
                                                     -----------
Tyrus, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou sealest up
-----
the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.

EZE 28:13  Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God;  every  pre-
cious  stone  was  thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the dia-
mond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the em-
erald,  and  the  carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy ta-
brets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that  thou
wast created.

EZE 28:14  Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have
set  thee  so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast
walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.

EZE 28:15  Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day  that  thou
wast created, till iniquity was found in thee.

EZE 28:16  By the multitude of thy merchandise they  have  filled
the  midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore
I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain  of  God:  and  I
will  destroy  thee,  O  covering  cherub,  from the midst of the
stones of fire.

EZE 28:17  Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty,  thou
hast  corrupted  thy  wisdom  by reason of thy brightness: I will
cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that  they
may behold thee.

EZE 28:18  Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of
thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will
I bring forth a fire from the midst  of  thee,  it  shall  devour
thee,  and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight
of all them that behold thee.

EZE 28:19  All they that know thee among the people shall be as-
tonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be
any more.



Anyone else to make a claim about the characteristics of the devil?

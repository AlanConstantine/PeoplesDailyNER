An extremely good example of "circumstantial evidence!"
Every time these right-wing control-freaks start spouting
about prayer in schools, I get this nagging commentary
from the Sermon on the Mount [Matt: 6:5-6] "And when you
pray, do not imitate the hypocrites: they love to say their
prayers standing up in the synagogues and at the street
corners for people to see them.  I tell you solemnly, they
have had their reward.  But when you pray, go to your
private room and, when you have shut your door, pray to
your Father who is in that secret place."

But no. THEY want PUBLIC prayers, the better to manipulate
children.  "Amen" indeed.

I hope you don't mind if I say "amen" to this? :-)

	The word "released" is loaded:  until convicted in CXOurt,
	my children are my own.

	WHen the Feds use this type of loaded logic, you cannot win:

		2) we shoot a couple of your kids

		4) we harrass you for 51 days
		5) we tell you to come out or die
		6) we gas you
		7) you burn to death
		8)  we blame you (prior to trial) for all of it

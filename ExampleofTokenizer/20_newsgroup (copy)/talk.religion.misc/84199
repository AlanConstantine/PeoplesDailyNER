	WRONGo.  Remember the fire movie a couple of years ago?
	"Backdraft"?  The scene in the factory with propane gas
	coming out of pipes and gasoline all over the floor,
	with a 750 degree flame front overhead?

		Note that it did not flash all at once?

	Fires ignite and burn unpredictably.
	Gases (like tear gas) mix and distribute unevenly.
		And flash unevenly.

	You are not a fire analyst.  You cannnot tell.
		(NB:  Neither am I.  And I cannot tell
		Nor is the FBI spokesman
		Nor is Reno
		Maybe we all should shut up and get a
			forensics analysis first.

>the building was full of it there was no flash of gas flame.

	Yes,. there was a flash:  in one room, just pumped full of it.,

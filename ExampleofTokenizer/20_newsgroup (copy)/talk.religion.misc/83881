And what is "better?" Better is a subjective value judgement.

I tell you a lie, and as a result you give me all your millions of dollars
of assets and move to India. From my perspective, falsehood was a 
substantially "better" than telling the truth. (How do you think a
log of gurus make a living?)

I attack your country in war, kill everyone and take your rich
natural resources. Before I did this, I was living in poverty.
Looks to me like war was much "better" than peace.

I see no need to go any further. Once you address this little issue
of "betterness" being non-relativistic we can continue.

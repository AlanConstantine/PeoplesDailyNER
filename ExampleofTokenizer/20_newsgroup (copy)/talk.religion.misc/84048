  Bill, I find it rather remarkable that you managed to zero in on what is
probably the weakest evidence.

  What is probably the most convincing is the anti-Christian literature put out
by the Jewish councils in the second century.  There are enormous quantities of
detailed arguments against Christianity, many of the arguments still being used
today.  Despite volumes of tracts attacking Christianity, not one denies the
existance of Jesus, only of his activities.

  I find this considerably more compelling than Josephus or the harmony of the
gospels (especially considering that Matthew and Luke probably used Mark as a
source).

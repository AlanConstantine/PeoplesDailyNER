So instead you are asking individual citizens to place themselves at risk
by assuming that everyone who claims to be a cop, actually is a cop.
Around here the police have actually made public service announcements saying
that if you are a lady driving by yourself at night and you see blue lights
flashing behind you. Do not pull over until you reach a well lit, preferably
occupied place, gas station etc.

It wouldn't be murder, it would be self defense.

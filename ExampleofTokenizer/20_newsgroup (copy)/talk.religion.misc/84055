Slight semantical difference.  The LDS Church does own a heck of
a lot however.  They are the largest land holder in MIssouri
(where they think Christ will appear at the second coming).

I believe they also own some large beverage company like Pepsi
(that was why they had to take caffiene off of their "forbidden
substance" list).

If I want to check the original New Testament manuscripts for possible copying
errors or mistranslations, which museum would I have to visit?  If I wanted
to do this for _Alice in Wonderland_, I'd visit the British Museum where I
would find the original manuscript and be able to compare it to the printed
edition that I own (I'd find many differences including a different title).
Likewise, if I had a cast of _Archaeopteryx_, I could take it to Berlin to
compare it to the original fossil found at Solenhofen.

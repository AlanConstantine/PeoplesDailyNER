   So Rick, why not read the Bible for yourself?  It is written in plain
   english.  Decide for yourself.   

It?  That would imply the singular, yet there are many _translations_
of the Bible, many of which differ in choice of wording and hence can
lead to different _interpretations_.  BTW have you also read the
Koran, Vedas ... etc., plain English translations are available.
Decide for yourself.

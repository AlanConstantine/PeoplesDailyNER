For the times when I'm interested in the truth, I do.

This strikes me as rather obvious. What is your point about this,

Huh? Of course I intend that it works. But the fact that I want it
to work, and want to use a procedure that will show that it works,
has no bearing on the logical standing of the procedure that
I choose (empiricism.)

I don't see how this is any kind of problem, Kevin.

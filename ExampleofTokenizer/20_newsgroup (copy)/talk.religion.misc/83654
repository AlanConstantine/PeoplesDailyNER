No, it wouldn't be the first time a group has committed suicide to avoid the 
shame of capture and persecution.  Ask the Jews.  Go visit the ruins of Masada.

Automatic weapons? Grenades? Rocket launchers?  I didn't see any, other than
the ones toted by the government.  I have a feeling the BATF/FBI would have
been much more cautious had the BD's had a case or two of LAWS... would have 
made a real hash of their cattle cars.

:"Tea, ladies and gentlemen?"
That's nice... anybody attacks me, my home, or my loved ones with grenades or
automatic weapons and they won't be the only ones dealing death and destruction.
Uncle Sammie was kind enough to provide me with an education that included 
studying the Constitution, and even threw in a lot of time on the rifle range...
My oath never said anything about bowing to tyranny, although it did include 
"to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies,
both foreign and domestic"

How free a society is it when a religous minority is attacked by an armed
branch of government... especially when the most the BATF would have had
jurisdiction for would have been essentially tax-evasion... Hope you got your
1040 in on time.  From what you've said, shit happens and we should just sit 
back and accept it.  Not on your life!  My ancestors came to this country to
escape religous intolerence, and earned their freedom with blood and cordite...
I'll defend mine with the same, if need be...

And Peter is from an academic institution... that used to mean something... but then again, so did the Bill of Rights... lemme see, where's that Brown Bess??

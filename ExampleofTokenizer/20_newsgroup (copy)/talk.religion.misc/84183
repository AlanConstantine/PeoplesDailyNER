Of course.  The feast WAS the Seder, and the accounts of it are very clear
on this point.

The difference is the connection between the bread and wine and the body
and blood of god.  This is an old association of the Tammuz/Osiris/Mithras
line, and not really related to Judaism.  In any case, I didn't really
intend to argue the point.  I saw a possible association and pointed it
out, but I haven't the foggiest notion what really happened.

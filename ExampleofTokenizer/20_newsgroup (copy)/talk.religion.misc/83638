#What do you mean when you say "I would have no objection?"

Right, I mean that I would approve of, and if necessary (it isn't)
assist in such force.

#Do you mean it's moral to use force on someone who advocates
#the use of force?

With a few provisos, yes.  Minimum force, for a start. And, it
depends on what is being forced (on either side).   

#Or do you mean that sometimes we have to use force on such

My opinion is that our actions would be moral, and it would be
immoral not to act if action would be both necessary and effective.  
Again, there many caveats and provisios.

Note, my usage of "my opinion" is an admission that I don't have a lock
on morals, not that there is no truth about morality to have a lock on.

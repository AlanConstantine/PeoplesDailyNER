But you STILL value likely ways over unlikely ways, correct? If I wanted to
know the "truth" about, say, the specific gravity of chicken soup, I could 
employ science -- meters, gauges, scales, etc. -- or I could just talk a walk 
on a beach somewhere. Both have a possibility of generating the truthful 
answer -- in the case of the walk on the beach, it would have to be some sort 
of sudden inspiration about the specific gravity of chicken soup which just 
happened to be truthful -- so what makes me choose the scientific method of 
truth-determination over the "walk on the beach" method? Because I *VALUE* 
science's higher probability of obtaining truth, that's why. Everywhere one 
turns, there is intentionality and value judgments lurking just beneath the 
veneer of detached objectivity. It is an inescapable aspect of the human 
condition.

Well, I would add that the attribute "works even when not being measured" is 
*ALSO* something which is valued and intended, Eric. All you've succeeded in 
doing is kicking this up another level in the hierarchy of values.

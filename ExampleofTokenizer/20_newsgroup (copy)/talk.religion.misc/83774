	Let me get this straight: your theory is that the FBI 
accidentally started the fire while the ATF was deliberately starting 
it?  That would certainly explain why they've been lying about the 
whole thing -- that kind of screw-up really *would* be embarrassing, 
wouldn't it?  There is of course only one weak spot in this theory -- 
we only have the FBI's WORD that the guys setting the fire were 
wearing black, and you've already demonstrated that the FBI consists 
of bald-faced liars.  From this we can immediately conclude that 
they were not in fact wearing black, and that that description was 
part of the FBI cover-up.  Who was it really?  Come on, now, think -- 
who is really out to embarrass the Clinton administration?  The 
answer is so obvious I don't see how you could have missed it.  
That's right -- it was Robert Dole and the Senate Republicans, 
of course.  And it worked, too: Clinton immediately backed down on 
the stimulus package, didn't he?

>Still, it is something to think about.

Uh huh.  

Later he writes:

	Now I'm getting confused.  Did the tear gas canisters start 
the fire before or after the lantern, and when was that in relation to 
when the ATF started it?  Oh, by the way, the story I've been hearing 
is that no canisters were used, since they didn't want to start 
a fire (but we of course only have their word on that).

	As you may be able to tell, I'm not exactly persuaded.

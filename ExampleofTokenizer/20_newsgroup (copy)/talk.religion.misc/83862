Evidently Jim thinks I am arguing an `existence' issue.  It should be clear 
from my response to Bill Rawlins above that in this thread I am objecting only 
to the use of Josephus to validate the messiah claim.  The argument against the
messiah claim is not weak (maybe mine is, but in the hands of pros it is not).

There are indeed two passages.  The short one *cannot be used* to validate the
messiah claim, imo.  That's why I refered to the long, which can be used.  It 
flatly states Jesus "was the Christ", and mentions the crucifixion, 
resurrection and Christian belief in said claims.

The short entry mentions Jesus in passing as James' brother - "... brother of
Jesus, who *was called* the Christ, .... [emphasis mine]", and that's it. 
If original, Josephus has merely reported what some people say.  It is nothing 
more than an observation, one which lacks the Christian fundamentals.

The long is widely regarded as an insert for three reasons: 1) its way out of
context, 2) Origen evidently knew nothing of it, and 3) its rather inconsistent
with the short.  There is consensus among scholars as defined on the long as 
insert, and I see Jim agrees.  Consensus is usually reflected subtly, as in
Elaine Pagel's _Gnostic Gospels_ (p. 85), "A comment *attributed* to Josephus
reports ....[emphasis mine]".  As for #2, I mentioned in my original post that 
the long is a 3rd century insert (more properly, post-Origen as Jim notes).

There may not be consensus on the short.  The text, which discusses James in a
legal role, stands with or without it.  That it does not upset context makes it
difficult to argue insert.  On the other hand, an in-passing insert is easily
disguised in any context.  Nonetheless, on historiographical grounds it is 
worthless for the messiah defense, and that's why I didn't mention it. 

I don't know about the Arabic ms.  If you have a translation reference, Jim,
please let me know.  As for its "much less gung-ho" tone, obviously the date 
of this ms. is critical.  If after ca. AD 700, a watered-down entry in lieu 
of removal can be easily explained.

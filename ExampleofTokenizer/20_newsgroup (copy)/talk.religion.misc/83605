AR>>To answer your question above, why should people who are
AR>>responsible pay for the irresponsible acts of others? One

AR>Don't understand the concept of insurance, do you Anthony?

On the contrary my friend.

AR>What is insurance for?

AR>To spread the cost of illness/accident/etc that does occur in a small
AR>percentage of cases, over many.  Those who do not face the accident/etc
AR>have peace of mind that they would not be devestated if they did, those
AR>who do face the accident/etc *are* not devestated (financially anyhow)
AR>in dealing with it.

Insurance is usally taken out buy the people who engage in the action
for which insurance might be used. Would you ask a person who does not
drive to pay automobile insurance? Or a person who doesn't believe that
medicine is worth the time to by health insurance?

It is a pool of people who share a similer fear.

AR>This 'irresponsible' label in reference to normal but rare life occurances i
AR>stupid.  Bad things happen to good people, too, you know.

Adrienne, when you act to endander yourself or
others, knowing that someone else may be burdened for your action is
irresponsible.

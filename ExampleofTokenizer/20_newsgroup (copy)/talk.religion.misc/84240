      No, but you're not achieving anything either. If you don't want to
argue the point you're stating, why do you bother stating it?

      No. Read the (alt.atheism) FAQ to find out why.

> I give no proofs, I only give testimony to my beliefs.

      Well enough; if I feel interested, I might even listen.

> I will respond to proofs that you attempt to disprove my beliefs.

      I won't; the task is impossible, and I don't have to do it in the
first place. Why should I even bother to change or disprove your beliefs?

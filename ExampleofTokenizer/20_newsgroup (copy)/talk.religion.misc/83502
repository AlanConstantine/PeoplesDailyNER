Hmmm, give everyone a gun, free.  What a thought.  Let's see where it would
lead...  I have a gun, I don't like your attitude, I shoot you.  Your friends
have guns, they don't like me shooting your, they shoot me.  My friends have
guns, they don't like your friends shooting me, they shoot them. . . . Does
this sound like a good thing?  Sounds like it would set society back over a
hundred years.

Funding abortion for those women who can't afford it would save the
government money, not cost it.  The cost of delivery is much higher,
and those women can't afford that either.  Funding guns, as you suggest
as an "analogy" would *cost* the government money and would lead to
effective anarchy.  See the difference?  Somehow I doubt you can.

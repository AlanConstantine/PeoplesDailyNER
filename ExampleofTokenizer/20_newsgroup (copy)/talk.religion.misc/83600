       Since you have referred to the Messiah, I assume you are referring
        to the New Testament.  Please detail your complaints or e-mail if
        you don't want to post.  First-century Greek is well-known and
        well-understood.  Have you considered Josephus, the Jewish Historian,
        who also wrote of Jesus?  In addition, the four gospel accounts
        are very much in harmony.

Do you consider Neo-Nazis and white supremists to be Christian?  I'd hardly
classify them as Christian.  Do they follow the teachings of Christ?  Love
one another.  Love your neighbour as yourself.  Love your enemies.  Is Jesus
Christ their Lord and Saviour?  By the persecution of Jews, they are violating
all the precepts of what Christ died for.  They are in direct violation of
the teachings of Christ.  Even Jesus who was crucified by the Jewish leaders
of that time, loved His enemies by asking the Father for forgiveness of their
sins.  I am a Christian and I bear no animosity towards Jews or any one else.
The enemy is Satan, not our fellow man.

God be with you,

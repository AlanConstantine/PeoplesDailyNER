I will tell you another secret.  I get this burning sensation in my
hand every time I hold it over a candle.  The pain does not fill my entire
body, and I'm told the longer I hold it here, the less it'll hurt (it'll
eventually burn up the nerves, or so I'm told).  So I suppose I should just
ignore the pain, because holding my hand over the candle is something I just
want to do. I've got the right, don't I?

Your body feels pain to let you know something is wrong.  It's your body's
alarm system informing you that something needs your attention.

A fever tells you that you are sick, and need some sort of care.

Guilt can be seen as that "emotional or spiritual" alarm, just informing you
that there is something that you've done that "requires your attention".

It doesn't require a "personality type" to become a believer.  It requires
someone who is willing to listen to themselves, their body & soul.

For several years all I knew is I really liked dropping 'cid (LSD).
Frankly speaking, I didn't really care.  It was fun anyway.

It didn't matter that every child my wife and I want to have are at a 
*tremendously* greater risk of serious birth defects.

For several years all I knew is I really liked having sex with as many women
as I could convice.  Frankly speaking, I didn't care.  

I didn't care that I was putting each one of them at risk (as well as their
future partners).

It didn't matter that for the first decade of my marriage, my wife and I
will have the worry that possibly that last sneeze meant something *much*
worse than a cold.

The nice thing about pain killers, if you take enough, you won't care about 
the fever, shortness of breath or pain.

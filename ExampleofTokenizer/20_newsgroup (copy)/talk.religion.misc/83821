I don't accept atoms or gravity as fact either.  They are extremely useful
mathematical models to describe physical observations we can make.
Other posters have aptly explained the atomic model.  Gravity, too, is
very much a theory; no gravity waves have even been detected, but we
have a very useful model that describes much of the behavior on
objects by this thing we _call_ gravity.  Gravity, however, is _not_ 
a fact.  It is a theoretical model used to talk about how objects 
behave in our physical environment.  Newton thought gravity was a
simple vector force; Einstein a wave. Both are very useful models that 
have no religious overtones or requirements of faith, unless of course you 
want to demand that it is a factual physical entity described exactly 
the way the theory now formulated talks about it.  That takes a great 
leap of faith, which, of course, is what religion takes.  Evolution
is no different.

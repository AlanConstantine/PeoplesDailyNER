How does Husserl deal with the problem of recursion?  If 
intentionality lies behind the actions of a DES chip, then
intentionality of *what*, and what lies behind the phenomena 
in the world of this "what"?   Is there a grounding stage in
a world of pure phenomena with no intentionality behind them, 
or do we have an infinite series of worlds?   If there is a
grounding stage, how do we know we're not it?

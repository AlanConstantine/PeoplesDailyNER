Don't understand the concept of insurance, do you Anthony?

What is insurance for?

To spread the cost of illness/accident/etc that does occur in a small
percentage of cases, over many.  Those who do not face the accident/etc
have peace of mind that they would not be devestated if they did, those
who do face the accident/etc *are* not devestated (financially anyhow) 
in dealing with it.

This 'irresponsible' label in reference to normal but rare life occurances is
stupid.  Bad things happen to good people, too, you know.

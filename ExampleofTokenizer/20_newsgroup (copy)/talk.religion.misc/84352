Dear Joakim, let me begin by saying that these are excellent questions,
but that by asking, you will find as many different explanations as there
are respondents.  As a Latter-day Saint, I believe that all of us (you,
me, etc.) lived once as spirit-children of God the Father (Hebrews 12:9)
in the pre-mortal existance. In order to continue our eternal progression,
an earthly probationary time was required.  (To live by faith, not by
sight, to choose good over evil, and to prepare ourselves in all things
to become worthy of a higher order of existance.)  We believe that all of
God's spirit-offspring were once assembled to discuss the specifics of
this earthly sojourn.  One-third chose for Lucifer's plan, most followed
the Firstborn (the pre-mortal Jesus Christ).  Lucifer's aspirations ("I
will exalt my throne above the stars of God . . ." Isaiah 14:12-17, etc.)
resulted into the rebellion of his followers against the Firstborn and
those who followed Him, resulting in the casting out of Lucifer (who
became Satan, the father of lies) and one-third of the hosts of heaven
("And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast
them to the earth . . ." Revelation 12:4) as demons (evil spirits).

To get back on OUR choice to be born on this earth, and to be subject to
God and His plan (for good or bad, based upon our obedience and choices),
we made that choice individually.  (God speaking to Job: "Where wast thou
when I laid the foundations of the earth, . . . when the morning stars
sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?" Job 38:4-7).  We
lost the knowledge of our pre-mortal existance (the "Veil of Forgetful-
ness," somewhere in Psalms), in order to live by faith, not by sight.

You may not accept this scenario, neither do quite a few who rely on the
Bible alone, which offers only fragmentary insights into this particular
aspect of our existence as individuals, as sons and daughters of God.

#Who is god to impose its rules on us ? Who can tell if god is REALLY so
#righteous as god likes us to believe? Are all christians a flock of sheep,
#unable to do otherwise that follow the rest?
#
#Hmmmmmmmmmmmm.

(All Christians, by definition, ARE a flock of sheep, following the Shepherd
as they understand Him  ;-)  --But in any event, not all Christians believe
in the same theology, such as the one Latter-day Saints believe in.  (They
will cry "heresy" and other accusations of "perverting" the doctrines of
the Bible, while they themselves believe in a myriad of interpretations, as
found in their catechisms and various do-it-yourself Bible-study manuals...)

As for me, I have a personal conviction that the pre-existance scenario as
explained above, is most in harmony with Biblical doctrine, some Dead Sea
Scroll books, the pseudographion, other (Jewish) sources, and last but not
least, modern-day revelation on the subject.

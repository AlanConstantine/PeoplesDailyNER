Didn't expect to find you in the Devil's role, Stephen, but these are
the times that try men's souls.

Nine months, as I understand it.  No doubt this accounts for a 
significant amount of the time as government efficiency in spending
our tax dollars would certainly seek its absolute minimum in such
an event.  But my gut instinct says there is more at hand.  It took
some careful preplanning to demonize D.K. to such an extent.  The
attack meshes well with more restrictive gun control legislation
that seems to be the agenda of the day.  It also fits a pattern of
increased government interference in personal religious beliefs.

No quarrel here.  The BIG BANG theory is always apt at appropriation
time.  They just don't have to possess a single motive.

I certainly think publication of the warrant undermines the government's
case since it makes no claims of illegal action.  Therefore the federal
judge had reason to seal it.  But I am reminded of Senator Frank Church's
remark that "secrecy is the trademark of a totalitarian government."
There is rarely sufficient motive to seal a warrant in a nation of
free people.

How can I argue with irrefutable logic?  I have long suspected that
the government has become a mindless machine and now you go and
confirm my worst fears!  Has it become a BEAST that is programmed
simply to say "Kiss my toe and you get your piece of the pie?"
I suspect bugs in the program arise when agents or those who love
this critter have independent thoughts.

Yes, 186 seeds for a new Republic.  And 86 for...?

Stephen, have you sensed that some have been rejoicing lately....?

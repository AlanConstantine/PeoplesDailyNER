If the children are not being fed, whose fault is that?  You and I
have plenty of food on our tables while others starve.  Why is that?
God gave us this earth to manage.  I don't think we're doing a very
good job of it.  The only consolation I have for those suffering
children is that they will be received into the kingdom of Heaven
where they will never thirst and never hunger again.

Peace be with you,

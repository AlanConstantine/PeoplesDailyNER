"Christ" is Greek for "Messiah".  "Messiah" means "Annointed One".
"Annoint" means "to rub with oil, i.e. to anoint; by impl. to
consecrate"     The major prophet Daniel uses the word "Messiah"
in Daniel chapter 9.

How "closely" did you analyze the Bible?  Looks as if you didn't
get past the first word.   So was the catalyst to break your faith the
"priests" who interpreted the Bible for you?   Did you ever do what
the Bereans did to Paul's teachings in Acts 17?

Sorry, the San Jose based Rosicrucian order is called A.M.O.R.C, 
I don't remember for the time being what the A.M. stand for
but O.R.C is Ordo Rosae Crucis, in other words latin for
Order of the Rose Cross. Sigh, seems l'm loosing more and more
of my long term memory.

Otherwise their headquarters in San Jose has a pretty decent
metaphysical bookstore, if any of you are interested in such books.
And my son loves to run around in their Egyptian museum.

Cheers,
Kent

Hmm, it seems that this is the core of Christianity then, you 
have to feel guilty, and then there's this single personality
that will save you from this universal guilt feeling.

Brian, I will tell you a secret, I don't feel guilty at all,
I do mistakes, and I regret them, however I've never had this
huge guilt feeling hanging over my shoulder.

If things happen wrong, I will try to learn from the mistakes
and go on.

This all is a very clear indication that you need a certain
personality type in order to believe and adjust to certain
religious doctrines. And if your personality type is 
opposite, then you are not that easily attached to a certain
world view system.

All I know is that I don't know everything. And frankly speaking
I don't care, life is fun anyway. I recognize that I'm not 
perfect, but that does not hinder me from have a healthy
and inspiring life.

There are humans that subscribe to the same notion. The nice
thing is that when you finally shake off this huge burden,
the shoulders feel far more relaxed!

Cheers,
Kent

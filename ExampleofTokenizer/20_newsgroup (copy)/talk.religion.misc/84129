It sounds like you're modifying your definition of Christian to anyone
who *strives* to follow the teachings of Christ. Do I read you
correctly? And just what constitutes *strive*? Did Jesus say this and
define just what "striving" means? Can you give an example of striving 
that is insufficient to qualify one as a Christian and thus condemns one 
to eternal damnation in fiery torture? Do you self-proclaim yourself a
Christian and if so on what basis?

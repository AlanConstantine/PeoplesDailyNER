Well you know that you're getting somewhere, when you start getting
responses like this.

Kent, let me explain it to you.

If you are paying for a phone, and you don't want call-waiting, YOU DON'T
NEED TO PAY FOR CALl-WAITING.

This whole Clinton induced abortion debate SHOULD begin to make NARAL
nervous, because it has exposed a real scam.

If one is paying for a PRIVATE health insurance plan and DOES NOT WANT
"abortion coverage" there is NO reason for that person to be COMPLELLED
to pay for it.  (Just as one should not be compelled to pay for lipposuction
coverage if ONE doesn't WANT that kind of coverage).

A full third of the country flatly considers abortion to be murder
for reasons of conscience.  If the first amendment means ANYTHING at all
anymore, then these people should NOT be COMPELLED to PAY for "abortion
coverage" if it is so OBVIOUSLY offensive to their beliefs.  Or are we
going to start forcing Jews to eat pork, Quakers to fight in wars, etc?

No one should be COMPELLED to sign a defacto "loyalty oath" in support of
abortion in order to gain access to health care, ESPECIALLY if one's
conscience is so obviously against the practice (of abortion).

PS Sure read through the two short form letters I posted at the beginning
of this post.  I HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE.

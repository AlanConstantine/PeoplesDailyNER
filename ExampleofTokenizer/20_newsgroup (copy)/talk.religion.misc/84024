The rest of the story seems to be that the agreement for the broadcast
was for prime-time, and that Koresh never even heard it played. Wasn't
even tuned in to the radio when it aired -- so no reason to come out.

If later they had given him a copy of the grossly twisted newswire 
transcript -- I'm certain Koresh would think he was at the mercy of
evil itself. 

As to coming out after Passover, wasn't that just one of the lawyer's
speculations Peter?

	Yes, BD apologists.  There have been a number of posts defending
the BD's as some persecuted religous minority, which is sheer bunk.
Maybe the press and certain spokespeople bandied about the term "cult", etc.,
but that is peripheral to the reasons for the initial assault and standoff.
It was a weapons raid.  The feds couldn't give a hoot about the BD's 
religion, but any group that ILLEGALLY obtains and stockpiles automatic 
weapons is a threat.  This goes for neo-Nazis and other non-religous groups.
	So I have this question: If your religious group isn't stockpiling
automatic weapons or engaged in some other illegal activity, why is this
event a blow to religious freedom?

P.S. The analogy between BD's and Jews of the Holocaust is so insulting
and mind-numbingly stupid I won't even touch it with a ten foot pole.

P.P.S. Stop with the paranoid fantasies about the U.S. goverment gunning you
down just because of your religous beliefs.  Trust me, nobody cares.

This is exactly the type of thing I was talking about before. A creationist
appears on t.o, makes a completely unsupported statement the facts of
which he/she is completely ignorant, is taken to task, and finally replies
with a subtle insult. (actually two insults)

Just to make sure I am being fair let's check a few details. Jack, you don't
know anything about abiogenesis, do you? (this is no sin, I know next to
nothing about it either) I mean, anything other than this "10^50" 
probability thing which you got wrong in the first post.

The speculation involved is really your own, isn't it? How much _biology_
do you know, even apart from abiogenesis? Any classes past high school?
Read Chris Colby's FAQ? How much paleontology, geology, etc do you know?
Or are you speculating that its all speculative? Do you have any basis
upon which to imply that to keep an "open mind" one must allow that
the earth, universe, and all the creatures in it could have been created
~10,000 years ago? None of this is intended as a flame. To say that
you don't know a subject is _not_ the same as calling you an idiot. I
don't know _much_ about these areas, but then I am not the one
calling into question all of mainstream science. In other words, where
do you get off calling it speculative unless by this you also mean that
all of physics, chemistry, etc are also speculative in some sense?

You may have, in fact, not been implying that the rejection of creationism
is a sign of close-mindedness, or that the theory of evolution is especially
speculative, in which case I have merely misinterpreted
you. In this case the worst thing you could be accused of is unclear
prose.

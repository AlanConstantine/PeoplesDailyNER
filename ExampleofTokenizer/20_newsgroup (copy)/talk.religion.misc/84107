It was the BATF, but what are a few fundamental facts between friends?

You don't pay me enough to create long works of fiction for your reading
amusement...

The text excerpted appeared in the NRA Official Journal of March 1993.
The full text of the article is available for anonymous FTP from 
godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu; I believe the file name is "lawmaster."

It's a cheap shot for cynics to blow off the source just because it's a 
"biased NRA publication."  (If your local news media didn't choose to 
report on this incident, that's their failure, not ours.)  

So be intellectually honest and check out the story independently.  
Enough names, dates, and locations are provided; his neighbors also 
witnessed the BATF's behavior.

One warning -- you may or may not get anywhere attempting to research 
this through government sources:

    When Lawmaster's attorney went to the U.S. Courthouse to obtain a
  copy of the affidavit supporting the search warrant so that he could
  determine whether there was probable cause for the issuance of the
  warrant, he was told by court officials that the U.S. Attorney had
  asked that the affidavit be sealed.

Sealed warrants, hm... where have we heard about THOSE lately?

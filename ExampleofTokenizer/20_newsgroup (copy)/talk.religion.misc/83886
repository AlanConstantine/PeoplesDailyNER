The problem is, Frank, that you are bringing your own _subjective_ values
into the debate and on the basis of those values you are making claim
to something that there is not any evidence (that I've seen, anyhow) to
support. This is not unsimilar to those people who make claims to
supernatural gods, not on the basis of fact, but because it makes them feel
better to think that they can minipulate their environment by influencing
those gods. It may be comforting, but is it real?

If you are going to claim that there is an absolute or objective morality,
the very first thing you have to do is demonstrate that morality itself
exists as something more than an abstraction. Only when you have done that
can we progress to debating whether this morality is absolute or not.

There have been many claims that morality is a component of reality, but
then again, there have been plenty of claims made by different folk over
the centuries. Claims, without fact to back them up are ultimatly very
hollow things.

So, having said that, I would ask you to begin by demonstrating that morality
is other than just an abstraction. Care to meet the challenge?

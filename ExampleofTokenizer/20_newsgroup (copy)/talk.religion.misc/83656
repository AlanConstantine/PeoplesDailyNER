But how does one handle the nonrepeatability of the experiment? In many types ofexperiments the "prediction" is that the observed phenomena will happen again
and be capable of being observed. For example, in chemistry someone may predict
the outcome of a chemical reaction and then actually observe that reaction 
repeatedly. You can't repeat or ever know for sure the original conditions that
produced life. So it seems we could never say, "That's exactly how it happened."As far as we know that event was unobserved. (At least no one has admitted
it. :-) ) So unlike the chemistry experiment repeatability and observability,
strictly speaking, are lacking.

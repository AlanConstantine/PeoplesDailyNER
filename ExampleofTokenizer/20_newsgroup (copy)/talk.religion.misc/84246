Actually if Mr X had something to gain by his claims his
account of the events would nmot be the most respected. Case
and point, the resurrection. By claiming that the resurrection
actually happened the early preachers were able to convert many
to Christianity. However, if you read Mathew 27:38 (?) and the
case for the resurrected saints who walked around Jerusalem and
appeared to "many People" you would realize that other
historians (Josephus for one) would have reported on it all if
it happened. The fact that the Bible speaks of events of such
great magnitude that they would have been noticed taken with
the fact that they are not reported on by historians could only
mean that the bible contains many made up stories.

August 30, 31, Sept. 1:           Everything You Always Wanted to
                                  Know About Winning Elections, but
                                  Didn't Know Where to Ask!

Three days of intensive campaign training conducted by Sal Guzzetta, a
25 year veteran of more than 200 campaigns.  Students receive 990 pages
of professional campaign manuals.  Everything from strategy and
targeting to opposition research, fundraising, and field operations.

Price:           $150 if purchased by May 1, 1993

August 31 and Sept. 1:            Platform, Bylaws, Credentials and
                                  National committee meetings.

Shoot out in Salt Lake!  PLEDGE versus Committee for a Libertarian
Majority.  Will the party's membership and platform definitions change? 
Is compromise possible?  The Platform and Bylaws committees are
responsible for making recommendations to the convention concerning
changes in those documents.  At this convention, the party will only
consider deletions to the platform.  The Convention Rules would have to
be amended by a 2/3 vote to change this rule.

The meetings are open to the public.  There is no charge for attending.

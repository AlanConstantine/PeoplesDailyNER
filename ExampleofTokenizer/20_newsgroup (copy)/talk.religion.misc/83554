	Yes:

	If one's particular goal is to land a man on the moon, or to 
put a communication sattelite into a orbit within which it will operate; 
then orbital astronomy will be more important.

	However, if one is a particular fan Sonic's singing, or a competator 
of Sonic, say Mario and the Toadstools; knowing when he will record an ablum 
would be more important.

	I fail to see how this is connected in any way, nor where you are 
driving too.

Subject:    Catholic Right & Pat Robertson
Lines: 49

The Roman Catholic conservatives are coming out in the open to line
up with Pat Robertson and his ultra Right Wing Christian Coalition.
Former Secretary of Education William Bennet, a Roman Catholic, stood
beside the Christian Coalition's spokesman Ralph Reed at a March 3
conference in Washington.  The purpose of the conference was to
publish results of a Christian Coalition poll which was designed
to prove that the Republican party would lose major support if it
backed away from the "Family Values" positons of the '92 convention.

Conservative Catholics have swung behind Robertson's organization
with political expertise, legal assistance and high tech communications
support.

The Catholic Campaign for  American, designed as a Catholic version
of the Moral Majority, was founded by Marlene Elwell and Tom Wykes.
Ms. Elwell has been with Robertson since the days of his Freedom
Council in 1985 and worked for him in his presidential bid in 1988.

Ms. Elwell was hired by Domino's Pizza magnate, Tom Monaghan, in 1989
to manage Legatus, a "nonpolitical", Catholic businessmen's group.
Membership is limited to Catholics who head corporations with a least $4
million in annual revenues.  Relying on a network of wealthy contacts
at Legatus, Elwell and Wykes had little trouble forming and funding the
Catholic Campaign.

The Campaign's list of national committee members includes U.S. Rep.
Robert K. Dornan, Phyllis Schlafly of the Eagle Forum, the lovely
Pat Buchanan and Rev. Richard J. Neuhaus.   Also on the national
committee is Keith Fournier, a Catholic who heads Pat Robertson's
American Center for Law and Justice.  Another Catholic, Thomas
Patrick Monaghan, senior counsel of Robertson's ACLJ, is also an
active supporter of the Catholic Campaign.

The board of directors includes Frank Shakespeare, broadcasting exec
and former U.S. ambassador to the Pope, Wall Street executive Frank
Lynch, former Reagan official Richard V. Allen, Bishop Rene Gracida
of Corpus Christi and Mary Ellen Bork, wife of unsuccessful Supreme
Court nominee Robert Bork.

In the Winter 1992 issue of _Campaign Update_ the organization's
quarterly newsletter, Rocco L. Martino, a Philadelphia business
executive wrote: "Separation of church and state is a false premise
that must finally be cast aside and replaced by the true meaning of
our constitution."

Oh yes, the organization's "national ecclesisatical advisor" is
Catholic politician Cardinal John J. O'Connor of New York.

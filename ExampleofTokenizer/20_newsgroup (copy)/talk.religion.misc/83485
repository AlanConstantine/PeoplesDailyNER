Precisely.

There's no objective medicine; some people get marvellous results from
alternative therapy, others only respond to traditional medicine.

There's no objective physics; Einstein and Bohr have told us that.

There's no objective reality.  LSD should be sufficient to prove that.

I consider it to be a useful fiction; an abstract ideal we can strive
towards.  Like an ideal gas or a light inextensible string, it doesn't
actually exist; but we can talk about things as if they were like it, and not
be too far wrong.

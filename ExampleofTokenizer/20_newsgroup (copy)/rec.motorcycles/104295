Would anyone out there in DoDland be able to help me out in giving me
a contact to purchase a pair of military air-borne combat boots (9 1/2
D in size).  These boots (so I have read here on rec.moto) are calf
height boots that use only velcro for enclosure.  I have phoned around
and nobody seems to carry such an item.  I admit I have not gone into
the deepest bowels of NYC yet for the search but I have made some
calls to several of the bigger army/navy type stores with no luck.

Anyone out there know of a place that does carry such an item as well
as does mail order?  Any help would be appreciated.

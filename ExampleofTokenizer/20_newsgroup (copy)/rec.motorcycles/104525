Well, sounds great to me! When I have a real BDI cager tailgating me,
I've found that an effective strategy is to flash my brake light by
pumping the pedal. You will, obviously need a bit of free play in your
brake pedal to do this. It seems that even the most brain dead idiot can
usually discern that a flashing red light directly in front of
him/her/it may mean that something is wrong.

The two problems I'd see with your strategy is that the red light may
change before you can get anything meaningful out of your mouth, or the
occupant(s) may take exception to your opinions and demonstrate such
physically (on you or your now-parked bike). Admittedly, the latter is a
slim chance, but it would be enough to give me pause.

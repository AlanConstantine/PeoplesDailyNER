A useful tip.

How about someone letting me know MOTORCYCLE DETAILING TIP #19 ?

The far side of my instrument panel was scuffed when the previous owner
dumped the bike. Same is true for one of the turn signals.

Both of the scuffed areas are black plastic.

I recall reading somewhere, that there was some plastic compound you could coat
the scuffed areas with, then rub it down, ending with a nice smooth shiny 
finish ?

Anyone any ideas.

thanks

tony

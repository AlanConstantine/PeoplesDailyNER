 Whacha mean 'we'...ifin they (whom ever 'they' are) want to stereotype me
as one that likes to drink beer and watch lovely ladies display their
beautiful bodies - I like that stereotype.
  If you were refering 'stereotype' to infer a negative - you noticed we
didn't rape, pillage, or burn down the town. We also left mucho bucks as in
MONEY with the town. Me thinks the town LIKES us. Least they said so.

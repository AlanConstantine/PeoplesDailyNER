Have you talked to Kawasaki, maybe they did another version of the upgrade
kit.  Got to be worth a phone call.  Did you do the carb mod or did you buy it
secondhand from someone who said that it had been done.

Is that Orpington in Kent?  If so have you heard of the Ogri mailing list
which I run?  Its an email list for bikers in the UK and interested parties,
available live or as a daily digest.  Let me know if you want to subscribe.

Good luck, Dave

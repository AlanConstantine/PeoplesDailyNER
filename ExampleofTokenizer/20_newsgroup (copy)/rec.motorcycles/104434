Step 1) Join the AMA (American Motorcycling Association).  Call 1-800-AMA-JOIN.

Step 2) After you become a member, they will ship your bike, UNCRATED to 
just about anywhere across the fruited plain for a few hundred bucks.

I have used this service and have been continually pleased.  They usually
only take a few days for the whole thing, and you do not have to prepare
the bike in any way (other than draining the gas).  Not to mention that
it is about 25% of the normal shipping costs (by the time you crate a bike
and ship it with another company, you can pay around $1000)

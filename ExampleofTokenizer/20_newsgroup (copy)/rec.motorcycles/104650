You and the Beav should lighten up (esp the Beav).  I agree that
DUI/DWI is serious.  We should have reasonable laws, strict
enforcement, and tough sentences.  But, Andrew did not
post "looking for sympathy over the consequences."  He posted
asking for advice because he had an extremely high quote.  His
post was obviously valid because he later found insurance for LESS.
He noted why he was in his predicament but did not defend in
any way drunk driving (and has renounced drunk driving).  There
are too many repeat offenders to worry about and other BDC.
Why try to make this person who is no longer part of the problem
an outcast?  He has paid his debt to society.  Step off the high
horse.  We have all been irresponsible in the past.

With that said, I'm guilty of the same type of hostility towards
rapists.  I think it comes because I feel the punishment is not
severe enough.  The same may be true of DWI/DUI. If that is the
case, then it is our stinkin' gubment we need to change.  If 
we had a reasonable law about DWI/DUI with a stiff penalty
then fewer people would do it.  

At any rate, Andrew as paid his debt as defined by the law.
If you think that debt is actually greater than the law mandates, 
tell your 'representatives'.

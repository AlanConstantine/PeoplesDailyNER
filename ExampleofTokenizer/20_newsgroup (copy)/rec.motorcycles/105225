No, it is more because van drivers need a little support for driving
such underpowered pathetic and truly utilitarian vehicles.  Me and
my '71 used to wave and be waved at all across the country between
NH and CO.  Now that we live in So. Cal., though, I find you'd have
to damn near wave your arm off to keep up with all the van drivers!
This is truly vee-dub heaven.

I just installed a MC Power Arc II, and it seems to run great. I also
used MC coils, and neither the ignition module or the coils required
any new mounting holes to be drilled on my 92 FXSTC. A little soldering
and all was fine. Static timing was real easy to set too. 

On the other side of the coin, my local wrench, whose opinion I
invariably seek but don't always adopt, thinks MC Power Arc is a "piece
of shit" and says "all them Jap chips are gonna fail you one day". 
Needless to say, he doesn't like any electronic ignition modules, and
recommends the Dyna-S system. I think that's the one with the
Hall-effect timing sensor(s), correct?

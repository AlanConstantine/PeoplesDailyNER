I spoke to a sales dweeb in 3X, a Ducati dealer here in Blighty, and he had
nothing good to say about them... it appears they are waaaay underpowered,
(basically, it's the 750/900 with a 400cc engine), and there have been some
quality problems (rusty _frame_ !!).  Save your pennies... buy the 900 :)

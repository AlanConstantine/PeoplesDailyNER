	Per gallon (bushel) perhaps. Unfortunately they eat the same amount
every day no matter how much you ride them. And if you don't fuel them they
die. On an annual basis, I spend much less on bike stuff than Amy the Wonder
Wife does on horse stuff. She has two horses, I've got umm, lesseee, 11 bikes.
I ride constantly, she rides four or five times a week. Even if you count 
insurance and the cost of the garage I built, I'm getting off cheaper than 
she is. And having more fun (IMHO).

We heard about this from a newspaper article.  Journalists and editors
always pick out the most interesting and sensational "facts" for our
delectation.  As the editor of the Sun once said: "We never let the
facts get in the way of a good story".  You must have noticed how
motorcyclists get treated by the press.  They thrive on hysteria,
ignorance, sensationalism and one-upmanship.  Unfortunately there's
not enough salt to keep taking a pinch of.

1 hr/drink for the first 4 drinks.
1.5 hours/drink for the next 6 drinks.
2 hours/drink for the rest.

These are fairly cautious guidelines, and will work even if you happen to 
have a low tolerance or body mass.
I think the cops and "Don't You Dare Drink & Drive" (tm) commercials will 
usually say 1hr/drink in general, but after about 5 drinks and 5 hrs, you 
could very well be over the legal limit. 
Watch yourself.

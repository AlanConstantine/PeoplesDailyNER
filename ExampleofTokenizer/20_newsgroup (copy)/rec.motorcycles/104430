Bzzzt.  The 750SS is 40 pounds lighter than the 900SS.  I personally,
and recently, witnessed my 750SS do a stoppie with a larger-than-
average rider aboard.  He said it took two fingers on that measely
single front disk to accomplish the task.  How much more brake do
you need?

I haven't gone over 4000 rpm yet (still in break in) and haven't
had a problem with the 750SS being too slow.  The limited steering
lock can be a problem if you aren't prepared for it.  The mirrors
are very good, IMHO.  Someone forgot to tell their designer about
the "whazza behind you, she no matta" philosophy.

Hmmmm.  I don't see a 400, 750 _or_ 900SS in your .sig.  Did I miss
something?

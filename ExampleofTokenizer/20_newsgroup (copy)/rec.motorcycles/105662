_Cycle World_ puts one out, but I'm sure it's not very objective.  Try talking
with dealers and the people that hang out there, as well as us.  We love to
give advice.

>Is there a pricing guide for new/used motorcycles (Blue Book)?

Most of the bigger banks have a blue book which includes motos -- ask for the
one with RVs in it.

>Are there any books/articles on riding cross country, motorcycle camping, etc?

Couldn't help you here.

>Is there an idiots' guide to motorcycles?

You're reading it.

I don't have the grips, but have looked into getting them. it's my 
understanding that the grips themselves are the standard european 
style grips now coming standard on the 93 bikes (K1100RS, K1100LT, etc).
it's also my understanding that the heater resides _inside_ the bar 
itself so if anything I would suspect it would reduce vibration by 
providing more bar end mass.

I don't see why they wouldn't work with the old style foam grips aside
from the fact that it might cause the foam to deteriorate or something.
hard to belive considering they do fine in the 100+ degree texas summers.

'course, I don't actually have them so you can save your flames.

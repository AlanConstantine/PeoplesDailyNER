Isn't that one of those self-evident things like, "how do you decide that
you're out of gas"?

I have never experienced wind so severe it physically precluded operation
of a motorcycle.  It's more a matter of deciding whether the aggravation
is more trouble than it's worth.  This of course, depends entirely on your
own particular circumstances and personal disposition.

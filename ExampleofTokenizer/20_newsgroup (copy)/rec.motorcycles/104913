Orating with wild abandon, prange@nickel.ucs.indiana.edu (Henry Prange) offers:
%The grips on my GS are a wonderful thing in the winter and no problem
%in the summer. Vibration? BMW's don't vibrate. Everyone knows that.

I'd agree with Henry.  The grips are really nice to have in winter,
and aren't noticably different from 'normal' grips in summer.  

My only complaint is that the 'low' setting might as well be 'off'.
This has been complained about by every reviewer, official and
unofficial, that's ever talked about these grips.  The 'high' setting
is often too high for use with lightweight summer gloves when things
just get a bit nippy, but since 'low' doesn't produce a noticable
effect, I end up turning the grips on and off to keep the temperature
about right.  This generally isn't a problem when wearing thicker
winter gloves.  When I asked the dealer if they could fix it, I
received a consoling pat on the back, and their sincere apologies for
the poor design (actually, I was told they worked just like they were
suppose to).

Vibration?  What's that?  I ride a BMW twin.  You can barely tell if
the engine is fired up or not most of the time, smoother than silk
sheets.

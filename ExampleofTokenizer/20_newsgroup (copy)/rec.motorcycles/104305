This GIF was GREAT!!  I have it as the backdrop on my Apollo thingy and many
people stop by and admire it.  Of course I tell them that I did it myself....

It's far too much trouble to contact archive sites to get stuff like this, so
if anybody else has any good GIFs, please, please don't hesitate to post them.

Is the bra thing still going?

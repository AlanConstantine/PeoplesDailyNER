If this is the same as adjusting the shims between cam and valve, I have
the same question.  Do you buy a FULL set of shims before starting the
adjustment process, or do you calculate the shims you need and then run
off to the dealer in the cage to see if the right shims are in stock? 
Obviously the latter would be cheaper (what do shims cost?), but are
measurements of the shim need reliable enough to buy only the indicated shims?

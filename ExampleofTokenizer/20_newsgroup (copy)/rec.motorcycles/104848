the list as chartered is geared toward R100/R80 GS/PD/ST riders,
emphasizing the off road bikes, but there are numerous people on the
list with other BMW twins as well, as well as the usual contingent of
aspirants.  most all boxer talk is welcome.  the main list has about
50 subscribers; there is also a digest version which has about 10.  we
run about 10 to 12 messges to day, mostly technical with little
chatter and no flames.

subscriptions can be had via e-mail. in the text of a message, send
the command:

SUBSCRIBE 

to bmw-gs-request@halfdome.sf.ca.us for the main list and
bmw-gs-digest-request@haldfome.sf.ca.us for the digest version.  your
"from" address will be used to determine where you will receive the
mail.  

it would be a shame to split boxer riders between different lists
unless, of course, the existing list failed to meet the readers'
needs.

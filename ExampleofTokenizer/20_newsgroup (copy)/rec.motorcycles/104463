Yes.  Unfortunately, there is also the concept that the owner of a car
is not responsible for the actions of any (authorized) user of the car.
That's one of the biggest arguments against photo-radar ticketing
systems.

Trouble with that is, you then have no recourse if a mis-issued ticket
or a clerical error on a computer follow you around.  The City of Chicago
(the informal motto of which being "The City the Works") issues dozens
of parking tickets each year to people who have never set foot (or tire)
in the city.

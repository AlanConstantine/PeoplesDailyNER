  I am happy to say that some Harley riders in our area are better than most
that are flamed about here: I (riding a lowly sport bike, no less) and my
girlfriend were the recipient of no less than twenty waves from a group of
at least twenty-five Harley riders.  I was leading a group of about four
sport bikes at the time (FJ1200/CBR900RR/VFR750).  I initiated *some* of the
waves, but not all.  It was a perfect day, and friendly riders despite some
brand differences made it all the better...

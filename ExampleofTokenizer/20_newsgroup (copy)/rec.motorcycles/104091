I have a line on a Ducati 900GTS 1978 model with 17k on the clock.  Runs
very well, paint is the bronze/brown/orange faded out, leaks a bit of oil
and pops out of 1st with hard accel.  The shop will fix trans and oil 
leak.  They sold the bike to the 1 and only owner.  They want $3495, and
I am thinking more like $3K.  Any opinions out there?  Please email me.
Thanks.  It would be a nice stable mate to the Beemer.  Then I'll get
a jap bike and call myself Axis Motors!

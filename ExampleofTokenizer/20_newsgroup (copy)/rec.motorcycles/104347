This is pretty damned complicated. I just make a "back off" motion with
my hand/arm, and the second or third time even the most braindead cager
backs off. If they don't back off then, I find a way to get the hell out
of there -- the cager is either psychotic, drunk, or just a complete
asshole. In any case, I don't want to be anywhere near, and especially
not in front.

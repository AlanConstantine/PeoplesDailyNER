|Continuously, on this forum, and on the street, you find quite a difference
|between the opinions of what motorcycling is to different individuals.

Yes, yes, yes.  Motorcycling is slightly different to each and every one of us.  This
is the nature of people, and one of the beauties of the sport.  

|Cruiser-bike riders have a different view of motorcycling than those of sport bike riders
|(what they like and dislike about motorcycling). This is not closed-minded. 

And what view exactly is it that every single rider of cruiser bikes holds, a veiw
that, of course, no sport-bike rider could possibly hold?  Please quantify your
generalization for us.  Careful, now, you're trying to pigeonhole a WHOLE bunch
of people.

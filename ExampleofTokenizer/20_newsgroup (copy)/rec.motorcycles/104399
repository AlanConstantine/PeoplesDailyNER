I have had this happen to me often enough that I always look for it.
On my ride to work in the morning I come to a stop light where there are
3 lanes in my direction.  One for left turns, one for straight through, and
one for right turns.  All clearly marked.  Plus there is a clearly marked 
bicycle lane.  I ride into the right turn lane with my signal on and stop at 
the stop line.  Looking left to see if I can make a "right turn on red" and
when I start to move discovered that some idiot has pulled into the bike
lane and is trying to pass me on the right.  GRRR.
   I always do a head check on bike lanes.  Not always for bicycles. . .

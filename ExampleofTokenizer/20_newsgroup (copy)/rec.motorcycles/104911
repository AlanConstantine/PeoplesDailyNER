  When the bugs are splatting on the side of my helmet instead
  of the faceshield.  When semis are on their side in the downwind
  ditch.  When I can't see the road for all the tumbleweeds rolling
  past.  When the airborne sand/gravel is sandblasting my paint job.
  When all of the above is happening at once in the middle of Wonderful
  Wyldoming.

  Well, it *WAS* gusting to 87 mph.

  Cheers,

I was attacked by a rabid hubcap once.  I was going to work on a Yamaha
750 Twin (A.K.A. "the vibrating tank") when I heard a wierd noise off to my
left.  I caught a glimpse of something silver headed for my left foot and
jerked it up about a nanosecond before my bike was hit HARD in the left...

(Rest deleted)

Anyone else had this sort of experience?

   Actually, hubcap attacks are fairly common, most cagers being too
   incompetant to reinstall them properly after changing tires, or
   to check them after collisions.  Luckily, few are as heavy as the
   one that got you.

Silly boy! You read the rest of that jibberish! go back and read rule
#1.

OK, for the record, Spike is jointly owned. The registration says -or-
(Uhhh, what _does_ the title say, Beth?) Beth brought the ad to my
attention, I'd been half heartedly lusting after an SR500 for years. I
had successfully avioded buying it by rationalizing that I didn't need
to spend the $$ on it. Then Beth piped up with "I'll pay for half of
it!" I was beaten. 

>I also note that you lay no claim to Connie or Ol Sport. (Like I said, 
>obviously a lady of discriminating taste...)

Watch it buddy! Both of those are fine rides! Beth loves riding
pillion on the Connie, true, the 'Ol Sport isn't her cup of tea (she
can't get it off of the side stand) but she agrees that it's a very
fine ride.

So let's see what we have on the Batdude so far: He has a weird helmet.
He drags his knee in corners (thanks, Cookson, but how does he do it?
Hidden Bat-pucks?), and he only takes the bike out in the snow or rain.
Also, he lets Robin ride! I think I could have used a Bat-mom. Would
have made getting my license a lot easier!

There's a trend here: Stylish helmet, Stylish knee-dragging, rides only
in Stylish cartoon precipitation. Hmm . . . Could it be that we're
dealing with a veritable airborne mammalian poseur? Dare I say it, a
BAT-SQUID?? (huh? Bat-Squid?) It all adds up now . . .

Let's make the B-man an honorary DoD DuDe. All he needs is a DoD
sticker.

Actually, anyone have an address for Batman's current artists, both
comic book and animated series? We'll write and ask if Batman would like
to become an honorary Denizen! Yeah!

Special To The KoTL: Is there a precedent for inducting an imaginary
member with an imaginary motorcycle? Having seen the computers in the
Bat-Cave, I think we can safely assume that he also has imaginary
Internet access.

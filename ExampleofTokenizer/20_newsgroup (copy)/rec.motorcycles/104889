nowhere did I see you mention K bikes, which, being made by BMW, are 
welcome on my list. in fact, you go out of your way to say:

           "most all boxer talk is welcome"

your list appears to cater to boxers. that's great. my list caters to
BMW's, *without any restrictions* like you have. considering that the
subscription count went to 29 within 18 hours of my initial post about
the list (which was made around 10:00pm just before I went to bed), I'd 
say that there is a need for a *BMW* list as opposed to just a GS boxer 
list.

my motivation for setting up the BMW list came from an earlier post of 
yours announcing your boxer list. it didn't fit my needs.

ok, we've pissed on each other's list. let's get back to the regular
net.noise and read our respective lists.

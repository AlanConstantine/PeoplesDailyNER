What's the problem here?  Back in 1958 I rode a Puch 175 from Paris to
Barcelona and back.  That was a two stroke, and back then it was representative
of the size of bikes on the road.  A 350 was considered a big bike, and the
superbikes of the day were 500cc or 600cc.  Anything bigger was real rare.

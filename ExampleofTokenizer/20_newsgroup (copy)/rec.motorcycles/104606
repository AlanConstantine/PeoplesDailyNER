Sebastian C Sears, on the Tue, 13 Apr 1993 02:32:13 GMT wibbled:

:                  ... Came around a right hand sweeper (going around
: 	45 mph) only to find a cager going around 30 mph, calmly driving 
:       along, with no other traffic around, in *my* lane. Not crossing 
:       the line, not swerving, fully and totally within the south-bound 
:       lane of 9W (one lane each direction).

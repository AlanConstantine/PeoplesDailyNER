My Kawasaki KZ 750 L4 has 2-3 millimetres of play on the gearchange
pedal axle, in other words, I can move the axle sideways & up-and-down
for few millimetres to each direction. This doesn't bother me when
riding, but I guess fixing it wouldn't hurt. Last summer I took the
bike to a shop to have the valves adjusted, and the mechanic mentioned
that it should be an easy job. All I would have to do is to remove the
front sprocket cover and replace a bushing or a seal that I would find
there. Well, upon a closer inspection I discovered that the gearchange
axle doesn't even run through the sprocket cover. It seems that, in
addition to removing the cover, I would have at least to remove the
sprocket and then the cover that is behind the sprocket.

Question : Would removing this small cover from the left side of the
engine enable me to lay my hands on that bushing/seal (Don't know the
exact term in english, sorry) ?

Question : Has anybody done this disassembly job for this or some
other purpose ? Does the oil, for example, stay inside the engine ?

Thanks !

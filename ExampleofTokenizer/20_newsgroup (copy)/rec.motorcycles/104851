Hi boys and girls.  I just bought a Beemer R80GS and realized abruptly that 
I am a grad student.  I first sold my truck yesterday but I need to sell my 
Zephyr too.

If I can sell it this month, great ... insurance and tags both run out in
a couple of weeks.  Otherwise I'll tag and insure it and see what happens.

It's a very sweet bike.  6100 miles, almost all highway (AZ-WY-CO last summer,
plus some great rides between here and the Border.  Purchased new exactly
one year ago (Apr '92), it's a '90 model.  It has a good fairing and a
luggage rack.  Red; very clean.  Perfect maintenance, no bullshit.   I'll spare
any further details other than to say (1) I want to keep it, and (2) somebody
5'7" +/- 5" will fit it like a charm.  Not a bike for big people, but not a
small bike.  Standard, upright positioning and good-looking.  Smooth power,
great brakes, good Karma.

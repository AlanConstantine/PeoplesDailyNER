man, every time this thread comes up, i start jumping up and down screaming '
EASY WHEELS! EASY WHEELS!' but to date, it seems like _i'm_ the only one who'
s ever seen this. it's absolutely hysterical. basic plot is this:

reporter searching for a ring of babysnatchers is blow off the road by a (
very hot) gang of babe bikers in leather. he is rescued from his wrecked car 
in the desert by a xtian gospal biker band lead by an ex viet-nam vet with a 
steel plate in his head that gives him visions from time to time. they soon 
discover that the gang 'o babes is kidnapping children to be raised by 
wolves (the reasoning behind this is complex), and they set out to stop them 
and restore justice and order to the world.

it is one of the 5 funniest movies i have ever seen in my life.

			FOR SALE OR TRADE!!!

BMW R60US frame and misc.,converted to Earles fork. The package includes:

	Frame, swingarm and Earles fork
	Final drive(27/8)
	Rear fender, front fender, large tank
	Steel wheels laced w/ ss spokes, one new rim, one EC used rim
	All brackets, brake hdware, footrests etc.
	The colour scheme used is the original BMW optional Bristol grey
	Items not painted are: Earles rigid section(needs straightening,
		this rigid section was bent when I received it, not from 
		being mounted to the R60US frame),Earles swingarm and the 
		headlight shell. I have the paintthat was used and can 
		finish the non-painted items if desired. The striping 
		was done by Holt Design.
	Not included: engine, gearbox, electrics, seat.

This is a clean and tidy project. The project was terminated due to lack of
	time and the R69(35hp) engine that was to be used was transferred 
	to another project. I would prefer to sell the package as whole.
	I am negotiable as to what can be included in the package, I will
	not separate any of the painted items. I am willing to take /2
	spares in trade. 

e-mail any inquiries. thanx. Carl.....

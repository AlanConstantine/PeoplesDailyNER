if I remember right, I heard that in the last election, only 18% of the
members actually cast votes. I wonder if the current board and their
friends and relatives make up 18% of the membership :-) :-)  I certainly
plan on staying with the club long enough to vote and to see the results.

I wouldn't support the MOA becoming politically active in that sense.
the AMA already knows how to do that and I'd rather see the MOA support
the AMA in a manner that the *AMA* needs. I think that more could be
accomplished from one strong front rather than two not neccessarily 
coordinated ones.

I need help getting my ZX-11 (C3) to behave.  I've managed to get
the front suspension to be very happy, but the rear sucks.  I can't
do anything with it to make it feel ok.  The bike is very stable
through the corners (I think because I have the front just right),
but when the straights get bumpy the rear is torturous.  It feels
like it actually amplifies the bumps.  And the damping doesn't seem
to do anything in real-life, although you can tell the difference
when the bike isn't moving.  I've tried 4-5 cm of sag (from
completeley unloaded), but I don't know which way to go.  Has anyone
gotten the rear of this bike comfortable?  And if so, what kind of
settings (esp. what sag) did you use.  I like to corner, but I also
would like my kidneys to remain intact.  This thing makes the new
ZX-7 feel comfy....

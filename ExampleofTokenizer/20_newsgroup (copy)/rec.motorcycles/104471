	Is there no JUSTICE?!

	If I lost my leg when I was 19, and had to give up motorcycling
(assuming David didn't know that it can be done one-legged,) I too would want
to get swamped.... maybe even for ten years!  I'll admit, I'd probably prefer
homebrew to pubbrew, but still...

	Judge Coterill is in some serious trouble, I can tell you that.  Any
chance you can get to him and convince him his ruling was backward, Nick?

	Perhaps the lad deserved something for starting a brawl (bad form...
horribly bad form,) but for getting drunk?  That, I thought, was ones natural
born right!  And for spending his own money?  My goodness, who cares what one
does with one's own moolah, even if one spends it recklessly?

	I'm ashamed of humanity.

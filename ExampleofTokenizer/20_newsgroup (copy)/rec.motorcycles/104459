	I'll second that.  In addition, I find my hazards to be more
often used than my horn.  At speeds below 40mph on the interstates,
quite common in mountains with trucks, some states require flashers.
In rural areas, flashers let the guy behind you know there is a tractor
with a rather large implement behind it in the way.  Use them whenever 
you need to communicate that things will deviate from the norm.

	Is that ZX-11 painted green?  Since the green Triumph 650 that
a friend owned was sold off, her name is now free for adoption.  How
does the name "Thunderpickle" grab you?

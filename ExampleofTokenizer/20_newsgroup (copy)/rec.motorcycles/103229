Who mentioned dirtbikes? We're talking highway speeds here. If you go 70mph
on your dirtbike then feel free to contribute.

Because it wouldn't be a Jeep if it didn't. A friend of mine just bought one
and it has more warning stickers than those little 4-wheelers (I guess that's
becuase it's a big 4 wheeler). Anyway, it's written in about ten places that
the windshield should remain up at all times, and it looks like they've made
it a pain to put it down anyway, from what he says. To be fair, I do admit
that it would be a similar matter to drive a windscreenless Jeep on the 
highway as for bikers. They may participate in this discussion, but they're
probably few and far between, so I maintain that this topic is of interest
primarily to bikers.

Notice how Ed picked on the more insignificant (the lower case part) of the 
two parts of the statement. Besides, around here it is quite rare to see 
bikers wear goggles on the street. It's either full face with shield, or 
open face with either nothing or aviator sunglasses. My experience of 
bicycling with contact lenses and sunglasses says that non-wraparound 
sunglasses do almost nothing to keep the crap out of ones eyes.

Ok, ok, fine, whatever you say, but lets make some attmept to stick to the
point. I've been out on the road where I had to stop every half hour to clean
my shield there were so many bugs (and my jacket would be a blood-splattered
mess) and I'd see guys with shorty helmets, NO GOGGLES, long beards and tight
t-shirts merrily cruising along on bikes with no windscreens. Lets be really
specific this time, so that even Ed understands. Does anbody think that 
splattering bugs with one's face is fun, or are there other reasons to do it?
Image? Laziness? To make a point about freedom of bug splattering?

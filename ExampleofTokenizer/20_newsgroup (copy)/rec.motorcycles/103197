	I've already discussed this in e-mail with Jonathan.  It's the film
"The Inspector General"  [:-)], with Danny Kaye, although I can't quote the
name of the leading lady (Because Maltin doesn't :-().  Jonathan thinks there
was an earlier Russian film; "Movies on TV" just says it was based on a Gogol
(Yes, Jonathan, I looked it up again -- only two o's) story.

Well, it's closer to Bryce than Bryce is to Arches. I'd spend a lot
of time studying the maps, there's a lot of "you can't get there from
here" in that area. You might want to hit the Grand Canyon on the way
up from California, loop around to Canyonlands/Moab/Arches, and then
back down towards Bryce & Zion on the way home.

Make sure you ride US 12 between Capitol Reef and Bryce, it's been on a
number of "top 10 roads" lists.


A nice booklet detailing a lot of interesting paved (Byways) and unpaved
(Backways) roads can be ordered from the Utah Travel Council. I think
you can also get a state map from them just for asking.

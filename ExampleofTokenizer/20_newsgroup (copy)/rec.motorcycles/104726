From _Cycle_World_ magazine (5/93) (who usually never says _anything_
bad about any motorcycle):

"The Max certainly has motor, but there are some things it is short of.
It is short of chassis.  It loves straight lines; aimed in one, it is
nicely stable.  But it is not overfond of corners.  Forced into one, it
protests, shaking its head, chattering its front tire, grinding its
footpegs, and generally making known its preference for straight
pavement.  Bumps?  It doesn't like them either.  Its fork isn't too bad,
though it is soft enough that it can be bottomed under hard braking.
The shocks, though which work on that short-travel, shaft-drive
swingarm, are firm to the point of harshness."

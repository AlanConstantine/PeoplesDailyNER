One day out riding, my friend and i were passing a field of goats and
noticed 2 out on the road. As we slowed to pass the ram made a dash at 
my friend just missing him and then tangling it self up in the barb wire
fence. Being good samaritains and generally nice guys we turned around to 
untrangle the goat from the barbed wire. As I pulled up next to him
(seeing him still tangled up), stopped the bike and got off the Goat had
vanished (into the field I guess).

]I was enjoying lunch this saturday at foodies in Milford NH with an assortment

]country, yet) mentioned that the wiring diagram of the VFR750 
]shows that  the light switch is a three position switch. 

]high beam
]low beam
]Both beams

]Well the actual ergonomics of the switch make it appear to be a
]2 position switch, but sure enough as Deam expected , when
]you balance the toggle switch in the center position both the high
]and low beams go on.

]This provides a very nice light coverage of the road.

]This is true for the St11 and the VFR750 and I would expect for any 
]other late model Honda with the standard two position light switch.

]Thanks to Dean for reading the schematics, try it you'll like it.

	Be a bit careful doing this; I used to balance the switch on my GS550B
avec Cibie' H4 insert so that both beams were on.  I eventually fried the
main ignition switch, as it wasn't designed to pass that sort of current.

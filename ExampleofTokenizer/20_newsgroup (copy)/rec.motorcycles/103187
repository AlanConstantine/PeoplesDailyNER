I'm about to undertake changing the fork seals on my '88 EX500.  My Clymer
manual says I need the following tools from Kawasaki:

57001-183  (T handle looking thing in illustration)
57001-1057 (Some type of adapter for the end of the T handle)
57001-1091 No illustration of this tool and the manual just refers to it
           as "the kawasaki tool."
57001-1058 Oil seal and bearing remover.

How necessary are these tools?  Considering the dealers around here didn't
have the Clymer manual, fork seals, and a turn signal assembly in stock I
really doubt they have these tools in stock and I'd really like to get this
done this week.   Any help would be appreciated as always.

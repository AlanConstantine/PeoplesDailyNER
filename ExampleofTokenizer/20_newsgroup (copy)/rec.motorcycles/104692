    Vintage Brakes
    176 Bluefield Ave.
    Newbury Park, CA.  91320
    (805)498-5527

    They reline all types of obsolete motorcycle brake shoes with Ferodo
material.

>Also any other Maicoletta owners anywhere to have contact with.

    Place to try:

    Deutsches Motorrad Register
    8663 Grover Place
    Shreveport, LA 71115
    (club for all types of two-wheeled German equipment, including
     scooters.  I periodically see ads for Maico scooter stuff in their
     newsletter.)

I don't believe that BA have anything to do with RR.  It's a seperate
company from the RR Aero-Engine company.  I think that the government
own a stake.  Unfortunately they owned a stake of Jaguar too, until
they decided to make a quick buck and sold it to Ford.  Bastards.
This is definitely the ultimate Arthur-Daley government.

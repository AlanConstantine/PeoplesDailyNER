you presumed you needed to "split" out a GS list.
by implication of your "split", a plain ol' bmw
list wouldn't meet the GS riders' needs.

for the sake of not forcing the split issue,
how about changing the charter and renaming
your list from bmw-gs to just bmw?  would that
make everybody happy?

i think you'd get better participation this way.
and joe wouldn't have to burden his 286.  :-)

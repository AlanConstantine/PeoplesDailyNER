I really didn't mean to imply that my Ninja was any better than a Duc.  
I have to talked to a few Duc owners (750SS owners in particular) who
say that the power is something less than overwhelming.  That said,
I would love to have a 900SS.  I guess I should have been a bit more
specific.  If you have something that weighs that same as the 750, go 
for the extra cubes.  

I think that fact that I own a GTV-6 shows that I don't care about maximum
power (it's no slug though) to the exclusion of everything else.  The note 
and the handling are more important to me.  I just bought a Ninja because I 
couldn't afford a Duc.

Didn't mean to ruffle any feathers, I'll probably be getting a 900SS next
year...

My best advice would be to contact a local dealer (see the yellow
pages under "Motorcycle Dealers") and ask for the address of the local
section BMW Owners Club.  The local BMW dealer will give you details
of the BMW Insurance terms and the club will help you with all
details.  Getting a bike from the dealer is the best bet, if you can
afford it.  The warranty is fairly handy as BM bits are made from
solid gold, apart from the parts made from ruby and platinum.  Apparently.

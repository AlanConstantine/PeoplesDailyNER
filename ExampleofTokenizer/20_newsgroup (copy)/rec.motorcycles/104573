Hi

I t was very nice out yesterday in the 'burgh, so i rode my bike
to my gynecologist appointment. When he came in to do the exam,
he noticed my helmet sitting on a chair. He got excited and picked it up 
and started asking all sorts of questions about bikes and dealers in the 
area and the MSF course. Apparently he rode a friends 125 for a
while years ago and recently the bug to ride caught him again.

Needless to say, I had never before talked about bikes so much in
such a position, if ya know what I mean :->

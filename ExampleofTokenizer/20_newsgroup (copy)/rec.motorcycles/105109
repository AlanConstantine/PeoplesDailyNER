Well, here goes.  After lurking for a LONG time, I'll announce myself. Yes, I'm
the enemy. The enemy that also happens to ride an "arrest me red" 90 VFR. 
     Bike history:  (as if this endears me to the DoD)
     79 Honda XL 175  "High School"
     85 Kawasaki KLR 600
     84 Honda V65 Sabre "Cornering by Committee"
     88 Honda Hawk GT "Proctologists' designed this bike"
     90 VFR

 I'll entertain questions but my answers will reflect Georgia law and may not   
 apply in your state.  
  
  P.S.  Anyone got a Nomex suit for sale?

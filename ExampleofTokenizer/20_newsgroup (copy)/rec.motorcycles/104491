Greg,

I'm very new to motorcycles. Haven't even bought one yet. I was in the same
position about you. How do you learn if you've never ridden.

I took a class put on by a group called the Motorcycle Safety Foundation
in California. They might have something similar in Washington.

Try calling a motorcycle dealer in your area and asking. It's a good first 
start on how to ride a motorcycle correctly.

You make 'em up, I promise to order. I wannabe Badtothebone!

The cheesy "Live to Ride" eagles are sitting on my shelf, waiting for
the big ride down the coast. (It now looks like we may hit points
farther south than expected. How do I get in contact with Bay Area
Denizens? Replies to address below. Me n' Charlie will be along in early
or mid May.)

Seriously. I like the idea of temporary Geekys (Geekies? Geekae?
Geekii?). It fits the whole DoD image: it sounds bad, but it's really
worse.

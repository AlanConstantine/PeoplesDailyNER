I guess I was semi-serious. Without using my hands, I lean and the bike 
turns. When leaning, a torque is applied, at a 90deg angle to the front 
wheel's axle, just as in countersteering. However, this torque is also about 
90deg from the axis of the steering head. Instead of making the 
bike lean, gyroscopic effect makes the bars turn, but I don't remember 
which way.

Oh yeah, I tried this in the driveway, on the centestand,(as suggested 
somewhere else) but it doesn't seem to work the same.

There is a new DoD listing. To get a copy use one of these commands:

		finger motohead@cs.colorado.edu
				OR
		mail motohead@cs.colorado.edu

If you send mail make sure your "From" line is correct (ie "man vacation").
I will not try at all to fix mail problems (unless they are mine ;-). And I
may just publicly tell the world what a bad mailer you have. I do scan the 
mail to find bounces but I will not waste my time answering your questions 
or requests.

For those of you that want to update your entry or get a # contact the KotL.
Only the KotL can make changes. SO STOP BOTHERING ME WITH INANE MAIL

I will not tell what "DoD" is! Ask rec.motorcycles. I do not give out the #'s.

Sorry, I should have been more specific.  The 750 SS ran the quater in
12.10 @ 108.17.  The last small V-twin Duc we got in the US (and the 400 is
a Pantah based V-twin) was the 500SL Pantah, and it ran a creditable 13.0 @
103.  Modern carbs and what not should put the 400 in the high 12s at 105.

BTW, FZR 400s ran mid 12s, and the latest crop of Japanese 400s will out
run that.  It's hard to remember, but but a new GOOF2 will clobber an old
KZ1000 handily, both in top end and roll-on.  Technology stands still for
no-one...

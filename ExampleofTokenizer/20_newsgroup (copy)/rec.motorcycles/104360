The problem is that Squids and BadAssBikers can't recognize
each other's waves.  When you're riding a cruiser, you "wave"
by lifting two or three fingers of the left hand, without
first removing that hand from the handlebar.  When you're
riding a crotch rocket, you lower the left hand to about
ankle level, palm forward, and call that a wave.

Generic bike riders actually seem to raise the hand entirely
off the handlebar and wave it around, so it's easy to tell
when they're waving.

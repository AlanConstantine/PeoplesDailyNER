 You know, I wasn't EVEN going to respond to this typical anti-party
attitude message. Trash was everywhere - reason? Not enough dipsy
dumpsters for the massive crowd. Oatman wasn't prepared for the vast
number of PEOPLE that showed up.
 BTW Michael, Oatman is the RIGHT PLACE & TIME. It's called a RUN! Maybe
you didn't read my comment that "They loved us" and I'm talking about the
merchants and townspeople. The merchants that didn't want us - their shops
were closed.
  Maybe I should have mentioned that when I left - the trash was being
picked up (aluminum sells) by a crew assigned to the task.
  I think the bottom line here is do they want us back ???!!! They Do!
This 'action' that went on at Oatman is TYPICAL on a predominatly Harley
run. It's innocent fun.
  So since I enjoy TYPICAL Harley fun at Runs - in your eyes that makes me
an asshole. I've already admitted I'm an asshole many times on the net.
All my friends are assholes too (lyrics to a new song?). So, you want a
dime to call someone that cares?
  It appears we have a difference of opinion. Maybe you should look at the
big picture before you pass judgement on others. 11th Annual. That should
tell you something.

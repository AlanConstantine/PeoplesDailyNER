Hell! This is WARM. I retired my fleece from under the Aerostich last 
month when the temperature got aboce 40. Try living a couple of years 
on the dole, so you cant afford any heating. You put the gear on in

seems like a luxury in comparison cos oyur usuallu going somewhere 
warm. 

Its all relative.

It depends on how badly you want to live.  The FAA says "eight hours, bottle
to throttle" for pilots but recommends twenty-four hours.  The FARs specify
a blood/alcohol level of 0.4 as legally drunk, I think, which is more than
twice as strict as DWI minimums.

BTW, alcohol metabolizes in your blood at a fixed rate -- one beer/hour will
keep your blood/alcohol level barely street-legal.  Coffee, hyperventilation
and other bar tricks won't speed it up nor will they fool Mr. Ranger.

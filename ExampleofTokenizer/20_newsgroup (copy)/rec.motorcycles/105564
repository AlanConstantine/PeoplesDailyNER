I second the commend from Dr. Speed, get a new tire.  It's like your
brakes, something you don't want to take chances with.  I waited too long
to take care of my front tire once and it went flat on me, doing 70 MPH
going down the grapevine towards Bakersfield.  At that instance, I would
of given any amount of money for a new tire.  I'm lucky to be here.

	Don't just nab it, POUNCE on it.  These are fairly rare bikes, and
they are MORE than adequate for putting a big brown stripe in your shorts.
Does a 50mph power wheelie appeal to you?  I thought it would...

	Only really bad things:  the stock clutch isn't up to the task.
Barnett can take care of this.  The back tire wears quickly (gee, wonder why?),
and the induction system is a bear to work on.

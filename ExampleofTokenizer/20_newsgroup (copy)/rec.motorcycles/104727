Apparently that last post was a little hasy, since I
called around to more places and got quotes for less
than 600 and 425.  Liability only, of course.

Plus, one palced will give me C7C for my car + liab on the bike for
only 1350 total, which ain't bad at all.

So I won't go with the first place I called, that's
fer sure.

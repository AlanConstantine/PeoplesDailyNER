Being related to former trainers, I have come to know that humans do have all the
advantages (well, at least one anyway). It is a little known fact that a dog will
involuntarily regurgitate and release an object that is too large to swallow. I
was told that if I were ever attacked by a dog I should ball my hand in a fist and
force it down the dog's throat. The dog would naturally gag and release, and become
momentarily disoriented. This commonly happens to humans when we go to a doctor and
have our throats examined ( Proof Positive ). In the time during the dog's
disorientation, the next move would be to wrap an arm about the dog throat in a 
choke hold manner and constrict with all your might until the dog lapses into
unconsciousness ( from lack of oxygen and halting blood flow ). Finally, run like
the wind to get away from the local area should the dog get up again and be really
pissed.

OOOOOOOpsssss. For a second there I thought I was in rec.beatthelivingcrapoutofadog
and not rec.motorcycles.

Till next time.

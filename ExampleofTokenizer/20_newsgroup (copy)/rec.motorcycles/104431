	Ahh, and just how were the carbs rejeted to "match" the changes
you made to the bike? A stage three kit from K/N or Dynojet?

	New CARBS??? Why would that fix it? you still have to get the 
jetting right to match what seems to be a extremely overly lean condition.
You added a more free flowing exhaust, and then higher flowing filters. 
Chances are it's to lean. BUT! This may not be,that's the big fun with 
carb tuning. It's _very_ tricky. 

	Your one and only choice (unless you want to spend many hours
fiddling with the carbs) is to take it to a guy witha  Dyno and have he
tune the carbs for your current set up. Otherwise you'll be playing
a guessing game for a long time...

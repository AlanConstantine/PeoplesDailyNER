I am in complete concordance with you there, Mike.  I was a Silver StarRider
instructor, for a while.  I learn't about countersteering last year
and I have been riding bikes since 1976.  We were never told about
countersteering when being taught to instruct.  It doesn't seem to have
affected me or my friends or pupils.  We just rode in blissful ignorance.

Doesn't sound like they attended, though, does it?  In fact, if we riders
need friends, it sounds a lot like we might have a whole townfull from 
Lynn's description, especially if the same crowd gets invited back
to party some more year after year.

You seem to be one of very few bent out of shape over these "lesser
indiscretions".  If the towns-people aren't ruffled by the
"indiscretions" and the partyers aren't either, maybe the "indiscretions"
don't amount to anything more threatening or damaging than harmless 
good-natured rowdiness among consenting adults.  The only thing that 
really bothered me about the description was the knee-deep empty beer cans 
in the street, but maybe the town had a plan to deal with that since they 
helped set up the party in the first place.  If I lived there and the
bikers' previous visits had established a record of mutual cooperation
and good intentions, I'd certainly rather they stick around and party
than go riding off into the night impaired and maybe get hurt or killed.

If it doesn't hurt anyone, and all the parties to the party benefit
and consider the entire activity to be benign and harmless, then who 
needs to "permit" or "justify" it?  You?  Why do *you* need to do that?

Ironically, these particular townsfolk probably are in the minority that
don't happen to fit the stereotype you describe.  They've developed a
friendly long-term mutually-beneficial relationship with a group of 
motorcyclists, and aren't as burdened with MC-ignorance as is the general
population because of it.

If such a need exists, it surely must come from within.

Well, you got the "self-righteous wusses" part right, anyway.

Greetings all,
	Can anyone let me know status of UK law about riding motorcycles.

	I used to ride one about 12 years ago and never took my DOT test ( One
of a whole list of things I wished I had done when I was young),but I have passed
my car driving test. I now travel from Littlehampton to Brighton every day
and I'm getting PISSED off with the traffic/road works. I thinking about getting
a 100cc bike ( Don't Laugh ) just to get "Streetwise" and to take my test, then
to get a bigger one ( 400 to 600 cc ).

	Now I have been told I don't have to do the CBT but what will I have
to do to get a full licence ?

Thanks in advanced

Leigh

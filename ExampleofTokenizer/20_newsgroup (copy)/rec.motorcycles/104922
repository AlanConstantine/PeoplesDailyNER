Automatic revocation of your license for a year.  I'm not sure it's the
"toughtest" law around, but NC has absolutely no sense of humor with
respect to driving laws, anyway.  I think they put you in jail and sell
your first child into slavery for passing a school bus...

A bill breezed through the NC House to lower the intoxification level
from .1 to .08.  It faces stiff opposition in the Senate.  Recently,
the Highway Patrol took a few of the opposition Senators out and gave
them some shots, and when they hit .07, put them on a course dodging
cones.  They failed, and will probably change their votes as a result.

For some bizarre reason, NC is the only state where the governer has no
veto power over legislation coming out of the state Congress, so his
opinion on the matter is moot.

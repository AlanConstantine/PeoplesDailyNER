I was posting to Alt.locksmithing about the best methods for securing 
a motorcycle.  I got several responses referring to the Cobra Lock
(described below).  Has anyone come across a store carrying this lock
in the Chicago area?

Any other feedback from someone who has used this?

Thanks for any info.,

Steve

Only buy what you need.  It would cost a lot to buy a full set, and
you won't ever use most of them.  I have had good luck with the
calculation method.  I have never had to change more than one size
increment at a time (I never needed a change larger than the next
size up/down, usually down).  They cost a few $ each for a Yamaha.

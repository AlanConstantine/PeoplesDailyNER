I have an '89 Kawasaki KX 80.  It is in mint condition and starts on the first
kick EVERY time.  I have outgrown the bike, and am considering selling it.  I
was told I should ask around $900.  Does that sound right or should it be
higher/lower?
    Also, I am looking for a used ZX-7.  How much do I have to spend, and what
year should I look for to get a bike without paying an arm and a leg????
    Thanks for the help!

	Not to start *another* shaft effect discussion, but the twist you
	feel when revving sitting still is due to the larger fly-wheels that
	the BMW R-bikes (maybe K's too, dunno) use. If you whack the throttle
	at stop lights, it'll really rock the bike over (to the right).

	Please post if you come to any conclusion on this. I am thinking
	of putting a light on each cylinder guard on my R100S, and was
	wondering whether I was going to have to switch lights off every
	time I was under 5,000 RPM :-)

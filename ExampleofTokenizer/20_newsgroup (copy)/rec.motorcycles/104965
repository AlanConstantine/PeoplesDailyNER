joe, i'm sorry you felt i was pissing on your list.  no disparagement
was intended and i would be most interested to know what i said that
made you feel that way.  i am not suggesting that your list is
superflous nor that it will not serve a need.  i just would like not
to see the boxer contingent split, but there is certainly enough net
for more than one list.

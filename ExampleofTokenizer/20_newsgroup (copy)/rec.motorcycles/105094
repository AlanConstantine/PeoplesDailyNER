Greetings netters,

Steve writes ... <about Cobra Locks>

Well I have the mother of all locks. On Friday the 16th of April I took
possesion of a 12' Cobra Links lock, 1" diameter. This was a special order.

I weighs a lot. I had to carry it home and it was digging into my shoulder
after about two blocks.

I have currently a Kryptonite Rock Lock through the front wheel, a HD
padlock for the steering lock, a Master padlock to lock the cover to two
front spokes, and the Cobra Links through the rear swing arm and around a
post in an underground parking garage.

Next Friday the 30th I have an appointment to have an alarm installed on
me bike.

When I travel the Cobra Links and the cover and padlock stay at home.

By the way. I also removed the plastic mesh that is on the Cobra Links
and encased the lock from end to end using bicycle inner tubes (two of
them) I got the from bicycle dealer that sold me the Cobra Links. The
guys were really great and didn't mark up the price of the lock much
and the inner tubes were free.

Later.

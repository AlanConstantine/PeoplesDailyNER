I was raised in the South, and I can attest that this is true.  Why, on
one particularly hot day, as I was walking along the road, some good
ole boys in a truck tossed me a cold beer!  Of course, they were going
50 mph at the time...

Bikers wave to bikers the world over.  Whether or not Harley riders
wave to other bikers is one of our favorite flame wars...

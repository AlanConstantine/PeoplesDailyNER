These are the figures from the Performance Bikes lock test, taken without
permission of course. The price is for comparison. All the cable locks
have some sort of armour, the chain locks are padlock and chain. Each
lock was tested for a maximum of ten minutes (600 secs) for each test:

	BJ	Bottle jack
	CD	Cutting disc
	BC	Bolt croppers
	GAS	Gas flame

The table should really be split into immoblisers (for-a-while) and
lock-to-somethings (for-a-short-while) to make comparisons.

Pretty depressing reading. I think a good lock and some common sense about
where and when you park your bike is the only answer. I've spent all my
spare time over the last two weeks landscaping (trashing) the garden of
my (and two friends with bikes) new house to accommodate our three bikes in
relative security (never underestimate how much room a bike requires to
manouver in a walled area :( ). Anyway, since the weekend there are only two
bikes :( and no, he didn't use his Abus closed shackle lock, it was too much
hassle to take with him when visiting his parents. A minimum wait of 8
weeks (if they don't decide to investigate) for the insurance company
to make an offer and for the real haggling to begin.

Abus are a German company and it would seem not well represented in the US
but very common in the UK. The UK distributor, given in the above article
is:
	Michael Brandon Ltd,
	15/17 Oliver Crescent,
	Hawick,
	Roxburgh TD9 9BJ.
	Tel. 0450 73333

The UK distributors for the other locks can also given if required.

Don't lose it
	Ian

Some of us not-so judgmental little shits don't drive/ride when we're
impaired.  I stopped doing that sort of thing when a good friend of
mine got killed by a drunk driver who failed to stop for a red and
drove through the side of her volvo in his '72 caddy.

Then again, I suspect most of the responsible adults on the net don't
bother posting in flame wars on rec.moto.

He also owned slaves, kept some as forced concubines, and had enough
resources to do what he wanted without fear of reprisal.  Then again,
he also smoked dope.

You're obviously not referring to any of the three above-quoted
individuals, because barnacles don't each send $20 to the crew of the
ship to keep it moving.

"Get the organization to act on it" is easy to say, but says little
about what one really can and should do.  What the organization
actually will do is largely determined by the president and directors,
as far as I can see.  That's what makes it so important to vote in an
election of officers.

It does strike me that the BMWMOA is a lot less politically active (in
the state and national arenas, not infighting) than other M/C
organizations.  Should we change this?  Or just join the other groups
that already are in politics?

(Incidentally, the political hazards to motorcycle riders in the US at
the moment don't compare to the problems of some other groups like gun
owners.  Just try to take up target pistol shooting in the Northeast
or California, and I bet you'll wish you only had to worry about
wearing a helmet.  (Why does every thread on rec.moto eventually come
around to guns?))

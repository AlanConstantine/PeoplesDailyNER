   Newbie?  Eh?  Slap yer' credentials  on the table, Pete.  That'll  show

   And so you damned well should  be...  young whipper-snapper!  It's  wet
   kippers at ten paces if there's any repeat of this sort of thing!

   Now, in keeping with the  grand tradition of wreck.moto, let's  mutate!
   Take your partners by the hand...

   On Tuesday morning I spent a couple of hours (when I -should- have been
   working) with a  torch, brazing bits  of scrap metal  over the  biggest
   holes in  Yamadog's exhaust  pipes (s'mazin'  what you  can do  with  a
   couple of AA  cells and a  three-volt bulb!).   I stuck some  "gun-gum"
   into the smaller holes and bunged the pipes back onto the bike.

   So, last night  I'm on the  way home  when lo' an'  bloody behold,  the
   sodding thing starts  blowing again.   I check  it out and  the gas  is
   escaping from around  the clamp holding  the number two  pipe into  the
   port.  As far as I can see (it being somewhat "hole of Calcutta" at the
   time!), the nuts are still there  (stop that bloody sniggering, you  at
   the back!), but the pipe is a bit loose.

   This morning  I go  out to  the bike  and pull  out the  socket-set  to
   tighten up me' nuts (somebody give that  spotty kid at the back a  good
   slap  round  the  back  of  the  head!),  and  lo'  an'  bloody  behold
   a-bloody-gen, I find that the outer skin of the pipe has separated from
   the inner sleeve right at the clamp-mating bevel.  So, I stuff in a bit
   of baked-beanz can and a bit more of Mr Holts' very best "gun-gum"  and
   come to work (late again!) so that I  can ask of the oracle...  Will  a
   brazed joint hold that close to the exhaust port?  Anybody tried it?

   Oh, and if anybody can tell me  what the differences are between a  205
   and a  207  brazing  rod (made  by  "Gaz"  [Yup!   the  camping  folks.
   Surprised the marmalade outa' me, too!] in that place just off the Isle
   of Wight) I'd be eternally  grateful (twenty-sodding-quid for two  rods
   and I don't even know what I'm buying.  Bloody kanji!).

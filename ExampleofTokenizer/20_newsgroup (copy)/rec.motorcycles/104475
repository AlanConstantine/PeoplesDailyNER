I would be scared of trying to fit the one piece.  When I got my
two piece, I got the jacket in 42 and the pants in 40 (just due
to my manly-man of an athletic build, kind of thing)  No laughing,
please.  Seriously, I'm not trim and the 42 pants would have
been way too big.  Also, I don't think the 1 piece does provide
better protection.  If I'm wrong, I'll be swiftly if ever so gently
correct by the net.pansies.of.knowledge (as they like to call themselves).

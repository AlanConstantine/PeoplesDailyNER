	When I'm riding my 900RR, my goodies are already up
	against the tank, because the design of the Corbin seat
	tends to move you forward.

	Wouldn't the major danger to one's cajones be due to
	accelerating into and then being stopped by the tank?  If
	you're already there, there wouldn't be an impact
	problem, would there?

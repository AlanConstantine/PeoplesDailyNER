Continuously, on this forum, and on the street, you find quite a difference
between the opinions of what motorcycling is to different individuals.
Cruiser-bike riders have a different view of motorcycling than those of sport bike riders
(what they like and dislike about motorcycling). This is not closed-minded. 
To NOT RECOGNIZE this, is in effect, close-minded.

I scan it for information, a lot of it is NOISE and pointless flame-age.
(it's why I used trn, instead of rn)

If you have a problem with that, I'm really sorry for you..

}...FOR A WATERSKI BIKE.  It contradicts nothing for a motorcycle.

Not only that, but this morning I saw a TV ad for a waterski bike
(a Sea Doo, for those who care). I watched the lengthy ad very

the handlebars left to go left, and right to go right. In other
words, they were *NOT* countersteering.

So perhaps it is only *some* waterski bikes on which one countersteers...

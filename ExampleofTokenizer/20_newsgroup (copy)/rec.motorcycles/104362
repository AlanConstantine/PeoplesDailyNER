My driveway and about half my neighbor's driveways are long enough to
do a good 80 clicks (50mph for the velocity impaired) if we wanted to.
Granted, I live in the country, however I've seen neighbors whip out
of their driveways at the above mentioned 30 mph quite a bit- they
claim they can tell that "There's noone on the road for quite a ways."
This despite having nearly been hit myself by one of them while driving
a Chev 4x4, and twice taking my 10-speed bicycle over the hood of a
car that had pulled out, saw me, *then* stopped.  Same driver.  Same car.
About two months apart.  

ObMoto:  The scary relevant part is that these people and I live on the type
of twisty two lane that we all favor for riding- and I know damn well
that they can't see me on my bike, not if they couldn't see me in 
my pickup.

	There's nothing like the pitter-patter of little feet,
	followed by the words "Hey- you're not my Daddy!"

	(Sorry- I had to do it just once)

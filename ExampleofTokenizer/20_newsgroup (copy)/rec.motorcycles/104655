	I'm thinking about becoming a bike owner this year
w/o any bike experience thus far.  I figure that getting a 
decent used bike for under $1K the thing would pay for itself
while I'm at grad school (car permits are $$$ where I'm going
and who want's to ride a bus).  I'm looking for advice
on a first bike - best models/years.  I'm NOT looking for
an old loud roaring thing that sounds like a monster.  The
quit whirring of newer engines is more to my liking.

Apprec any advice.

Thanks,

BS

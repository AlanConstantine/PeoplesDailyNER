Is (was? :-( ) your HG zipper the nylon-coil type or the kind with
molded plastic teeth? I've only tried it on the coiled nylon type, and
it doesn't take much squish to fix the problem. I found I was overdoing
it (no broken parts, but the zipper was too hard to pull) so after
spreading the zipper pull jaws again, I tried with Vice-Grips. No, not
the usual Grip Of Death technique, I adjusted the closed Vice-Grips so
they were snug on the zipper jaws, then released them and tightened the
adjusting screw a bit. A couple of iterations and I had just the right
amount of Zipper Squish (TM).

I've had two zipper pulls fail on my Aerostich suit (actually on the
Accessory Ellipse), and they sent me a few replacement pulls free of
charge. I don't know what brand of zippers HG uses, but parts ARE
available for YKK's plastic zippers. Replacement was pretty simple, just
break and remove the plastic knob at the top of the zipper that keeps
the pull from coming off the top end. Slide on the new zipper pull. Then
crimp on (Vice-Grips again!) a replacement zipper stop.

You might try fabric stores & such and see if they sell replacement
parts.

Oh, for what it's worth, the coil-type zippers on the Eclipse tankbag
are also YKK.

	For those of you with motorcycles of the liquid-cooled persuasion,
what brand of coolant do you use and why?  I am looking for aluminum-safe
coolant, preferably phosphate-free, and preferably cheaper than $13/gallon.
(Can you believe it:  the Kaw dealer wants $4.95 a QUART for the Official
Blessed Holy Kawasaki Coolant!!!  No way I'm paying that usury...)

Thanks,

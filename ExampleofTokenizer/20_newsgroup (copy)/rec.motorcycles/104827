Yes, Matt, dear Newbie, best advice is read here foe a few days.
This is your best source of info.

(Kinda makes me glad that I discovered r.m well after I got into riding--
 could I have possibly sounded like *that* otherwise?  --eesh.)

BTW Matt, despite the insults you are destined to face, great move 
on taking the MSF course.  It will save your butt.

Good Luck,

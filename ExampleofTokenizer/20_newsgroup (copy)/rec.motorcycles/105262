The first few times I pillioned someone whose safety was a great concern to
me (as opposed to brothers, etc.), I almost got us both killed on several
occasions.

I was surprised to discover that it is much safer to just drive than to
distract yourself by trying to be unusually cautious and concerned.  Abruptly
adopting a novel set of thought patterns and riding strategies while piloting
a bike is just asking for trouble.

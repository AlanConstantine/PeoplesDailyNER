To follow-up, I had a bad experience w/ a Krypto Lock too...

Last year I bought a Krypto Cable II (3/8"x3-4' long, something like that)
that by all standards seemed like a decent piece.  Until I used it anyway...
Before I ever used it for security purposes, I used it for entertainment
(minds out of the gutter, please), which is to say that I sat fiddling w/
it while watching TV (the night I got it).  After three minutes of mindless
fiddling (of course it was mindless, remember I was watching TV) the entire
tumbler mechanism came out on the key!  Not unlike that old Georgie-porgie
nursery rhyme.  This left a very empty cylinder and a very non-secure 
(read "swingin' in the breeze") cable lock.
Kinda makes me wonder about any flat key-style lock.  One yank w/ a 
slide-hammer and Viola-- I'm making an insurance claim.

Anyone else have a similar experience (w/ the Kryptos, not bike theft)?

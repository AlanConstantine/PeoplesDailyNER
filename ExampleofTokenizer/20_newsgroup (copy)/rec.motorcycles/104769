  Nice ridin' Tex. I use the California DMV recommended technique:
slow as you aproach said dog and wick it up as you pass. I've often
contemplated putting the boot in said dog's muzzle as I open the 
throttle, but have never tried that. I figgure the impact would 
unballance me and I'd dump the bike. A bicycling technique I've
employed was to use my frame mounted tire pump to fend off dog
attacks. On one occasion I was attacked by a pack of four dogs at
once while peddaling up a steep hill. I lost my right sock, but no
blood. I complained to the local Animal Control department (after
complaining to the owner of the dogs to no affect) about the dogs;
no more dogs, no more attacks. The telephone worked much better
than the tire pump.

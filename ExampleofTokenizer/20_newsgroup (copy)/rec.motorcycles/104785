Oh horse puckey.  Without their cop partner in attendance, they are less likely
to be controllable *without* the use of force which would kill the dog.

O.k.  so you've disabled the dog's mouth, and given up use of your arm to do
so.  How `bout them front and read paws, and the fact that to plug up that

Have you ever tried to snap leg or crush the skull of a dog without use of 
hardened instruments such as a baseball bat?  Without the use of both arms and

Oh *now* you qualify you earlier statement by saying a *trained* human.

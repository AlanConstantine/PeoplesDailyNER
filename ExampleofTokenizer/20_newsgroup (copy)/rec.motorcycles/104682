	Good advice.

	My Ol'lady taps me on the shoulder to let me know she is 
	uncomfortable.  I, in turn, am prepared for her to move about on the 
	back of the bike.

>- Trust is essential. ... 
	We had 1 bad crash (nail in rear tire on left hand sweeper at crest 
	of hill on pavement/pea-gravel road) and her actions helped lessen 
	the severity of it.  As we were crashing, she stayed upright in the 
	saddle with her feet on the pegs and her hands about my waist.  I was
	able to get the bike slowed down 10-15mph before we were high-sided.
	She got off with a fair case of road rash and I had to have the doc 
	remove a lot of rocks from my knee.  Had she panicked we would have 
	probably crashed at greater speed causing greater injury.
	BTW, as soon at the tire went flat, we went into VIOLENT tank-
	slappers.  This is what she rode out in a "normal" riding posture!

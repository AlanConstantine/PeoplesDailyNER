I use Aldus Photostyler on the PC and I can turn a colour or black and white
image into a negative or turn a negative into a colour or black and white
image.  I don't know how it does it but it works well.  To test it I scanned
a negative and used Aldus to create a positive.  It looked better than the
print that the film developers gave me.

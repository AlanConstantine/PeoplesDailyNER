	Hi,

	I have a problem, I hope some of the 'gurus' can help me solve.

	Background of the problem:
	I have a rectangular mesh in the uv domain, i.e  the mesh is a 
	mapping of a 3d Bezier patch into 2d. The area in this domain
	which is inside a trimming loop had to be rendered. The trimming
	loop is a set of 2d Bezier curve segments.
	For the sake of notation: the mesh is made up of cells.

	My problem is this :
	The trimming area has to be split up into individual smaller
	cells bounded by the trimming curve segments. If a cell
	is wholly inside the area...then it is output as a whole ,
	else it is trivially rejected. 

	Does any body know how thiss can be done, or is there any algo. 
	somewhere for doing this.

	Any help would be appreciated.

	Thanks, 
	Ani.

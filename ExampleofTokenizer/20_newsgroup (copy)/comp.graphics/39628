as far as simply mapping your logo or whatever onto a cube or sphere, 
it's quite easy. Just either copy the GIF you want mapped into the map 
directory or add a map path to the directory where it currently is. Then 
go into the materials editor and make a new material with that as the bit 
map, voila..

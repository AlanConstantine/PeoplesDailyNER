I'm making a customized paint program in DOS and need an algorithm
for reading bitmap files like GIF, PCX, or BMP.  Does anyone have
such an algorithm?  I've tried copying one out of a book for reading
.PCX format but it doesn't work.  I will take an algorithm for any
format that can be created from Windows Paint.  
Thanks!
Toni

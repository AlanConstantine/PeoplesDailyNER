   I was wondering if anyone knows of a graphics package for the PC that
   will do compositing of a series of pictures?

   What I mean by "compositing" is, say I have a live video clip
   (digitized) panning around a living room, and a computer-generated
   bird flying around the screen.  I want to combine these two series of
   pictures so that everywhere where the bird frames are black, I want
   the living room picture to show through.  Yes, I realize I can do this
   with a genlock, and I do own a genlock, but I want to be able to do
   manual compositing also.  It's ok if I have to composite one frame at
   a time; I assumed I'd have to do that anyway.  But being able to
   composite a series of frames would be even better.

   I've looked around and I haven't found a PC package that will perform
   this.  Help, please!

If you can get the live animation and the computer-generated animation
into AutoDesk Animator .FLI or .FLC format, AutoDesk Animator will do
this for you.  It can take one animation, make a certain color
"clear", and overlay it over another animation.  I do not have a way
right now to convert .AVI or .MPG files to animator files.  Animator
will also import a series of .GIF files to create an animation, so if
your video capture stuff can create this is might work.

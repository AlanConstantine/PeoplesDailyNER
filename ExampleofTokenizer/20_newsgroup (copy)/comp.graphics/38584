 Our shop uses a package called CADCore - very good - to scan and
subsequently vectorize original maps into digital maps. The problem is that
once the raster file is loaded into the CADCore package, a header is added
to the .HRF file which makes it unreadable by the supplied converter. We
would like to be able to ship some of the already-altered raster images for
further use on our workstations. So, here are my questions:

 (1) What is the Hitachi format? - I need this format so I can recognize
precisely what to strip out. I strongly suspect that it's a compressed
format - if so, then t might not be possible for me to strip out the
offending header.

 (2) Are there any UNIX packages that read and recognize HRF? It would be
really nice to find some sort of "hrftopbm" converter out there. ;)

 I've already searched some of the more well-known ftp sites which contain
graphics formats documentation, with no luck. So, if you know, or knwo
someone who knows - please email! Thanks.

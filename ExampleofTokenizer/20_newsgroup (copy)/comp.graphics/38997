Yes, I have both Arts & Letters and CorelDraw.  I personally like
Arts & Letters better but there are things I like about Arts & Letters
that CorelDraw doesn't do an vice-versa.  I haven't found the perfect
graphics program that does everything yet.  

My favorite feature from CorelDraw is that it imports alot of different
formats.  Arts & Letters does not.  I like the thousands of clipart
available with Arts & Letters.  However, I do find looking them up
in a book and referencing them by number to be annoying.

One of my major problems is that there isn't any programs available on
the market for the artistically deprived :-).

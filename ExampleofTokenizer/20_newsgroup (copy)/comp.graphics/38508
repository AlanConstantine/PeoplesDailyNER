I've got the 6.0 spec (obviously since I quoted it in my last posting). 
My gripe about TIFF is that it's far too complicated and nearly
infinitely easier to write than to read, which I think hurts your
acceptance by anything that will need to read those images (e.g.,
paint programs).

In a nutshell, I don't think TIFF is salvageable unless the fat is
trimmed significantly- and then it wouldn't be TIFF anymore.  They
keep trying to cut it back, but it's late now.  Maybe they >will< fix it,
and change that magic number to signify the lack of compatibility. 
That would probably make me happy.

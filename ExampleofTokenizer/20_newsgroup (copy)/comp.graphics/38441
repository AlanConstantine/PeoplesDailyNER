Hello netters

Sorry, I don't know if this is the right way of doing this kind of thing,
probably should be a CFV, but since I don't have tha ability to create a 
news group myself, I just want to start the discussion. 

I enjoy reading c.g very much, but I often find it difficult to sort out what
I'm interested in. Everything from screen-drivers, graphics cards, graphics
programming and graphics programs are discused here. What I'd like is a 
comp.graphics.programmer news group.
What do you other think.

"Also for the not religous confessor, there is a mystery of higher values,
who's birth mankind - to the last - builds upon. They are indisputible. And 
often disregarded. Seldom you hear them beeing prized, as seldom as you hear 
a seeing man prizeing what he sees." Per Lagerkvist, The Fist

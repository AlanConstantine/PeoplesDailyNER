I would like to program Tseng ET4000 to nonstandard 1024x768 mode by
switching to standard 1024x768 mode using BIOS and than changing some
timing details (0x3D4 registers 0x00-0x1F) but I don't know how to
select 36 MHz pixel clock I need. The BIOS function selects 40 MHz.

Is there anybody who knows where to obtain technical info about this.
I am also interested in any other technical information about Tseng ET4000
and Trident 8900 and 9000 chipsets.

			thanks very much

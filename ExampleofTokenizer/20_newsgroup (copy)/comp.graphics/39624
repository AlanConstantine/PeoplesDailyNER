  In an attempt to do animation with POV I have created two little
programs. One is a C program that will perform a "morph" between
any two points given the amount of frames for the morph. And then
it will write the points, and the function (translate, rotate, etc.) out
to a file. Then I have a Perl script that will read the list of functions
and insert them into a .pov file at a given line. I had hoped this would
let me do simple animation. However, I have discovered that simply
performing incremental rotations on an object will not spin a stationary
object but will actually rotate the object about the axis. Now I know
an easy way around this would be to first translate the object to the
origin perform the rotation and then move it back but I know there 
must be another way around this. I had thought perhaps it was because
I had created objects at the origin and then translated them to a new
point and then done the rotation, which could cause this behavior. However
this occurs on objects that are not translated at all. Any help is 
appreciated.

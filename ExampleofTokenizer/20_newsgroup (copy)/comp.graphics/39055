I recently got a document describing the JPEG FIF (JFIF) file
format. I was looking thru it, but I didn't get the idea how
to determine the size of a pic in pixel without decoding the
whole image.

How do you get the height and width of a JPEG in a JFIF?

How do you determine wether it is a color or a greyscale
picture?

I wrote a small tool (lsgif) for GIF that returns the
filesize, picture size and color resolution by analizing
the header chunks. The output looks like this:

  157605  bla.gif                                  640x 480  248C24

I use this lsgif to create index files of my archive and since
JPEG are getting more and more popular I would like to have a
similar tool for JFIF, with an output like this:

   57605  bla.jpg                                  640x 480     C24

Please respond by email, because I don't read this news
group very often. I'll post a summary if it is useful.

Thanx in advance,
								Larry

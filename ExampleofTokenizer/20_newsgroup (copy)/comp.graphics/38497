G'day all,

Can anybody point me at a utility which will read/convert/crop/whatnot/
display HDF image files ? I've had a look at the HDF stuff under NCSA 
and it must take an award for odd directory structure, strange storage
approaches and minimalist documentation :-)

Part of the problem is that I want to look at large (5MB+) HDF files and
crop out a section. Ideally I would like a hdftoppm type of utility, from
which I can then use the PBMplus stuff quite merrily. I can convert the cropped
part into another format for viewing/animation.

Otherwise, can someone please explain how to set up the NCSA Visualisation S/W
for HDF (3.2.r5 or 3.3beta) and do the above cropping/etc. This is for
Suns with SunOS 4.1.2.

Any help GREATLY appreciated. Ta muchly !

Cheers,
	Markus

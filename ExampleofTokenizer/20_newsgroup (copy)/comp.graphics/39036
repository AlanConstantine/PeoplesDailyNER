How about the GNU people, handing out very good, free software?  I've also
distributed two decent-sized programs myself, the Go player Fumiko (at
ftp.u.washington.edu) and the Genetic Neural Network Programmer CEREBRUM

I've only had time to write these programs because of scholarships and
grants.  The intended benefit to society, or a loophole in the system?

Hi I'm new to imaging, and my advisor and I would like to 
do some 3D reconstructions.

We take slides (biological), and image them on a 486.  Then
the software allows us to trace the outline of the objects 
we want to save.  The outlines are stored as a TIFF file.

We would like to convert a group of these outlines into a 
3D image.  We are unsure as to where to begin.  Someone mentioned
that if we could convert the TIFF into a vector format then 
we could view them in Autocad.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I am involve in a Distant Learning project and am in need
of Jpeg and Mpeg encode/decode source and object code.
This is a NOT-FOR PROFIT project that once completed I
hope to release to other educational and institutional
learning centers.
This project requires that TRUE photographic images be sent
over plain telephone lines. In addition if there is a REAL Good
GUI lib with 3D objects and all types of menu classes that can
be use at both end of the transaction (Server and Terminal End)
I would like to hear about it.
 
We recently posted an RFD announcing the OTG (Open Telematic Group)
that will concern itself with the developement of such application
and that it would incorporate NAPLPS, JPEG, MPEG, Voice, IVR, FAX
Sprites, Animation(fli, flc, etc...).
At present only DOS and UNIX environment is being worked on and it
our hope that we can generate enough interest where all the major
platform can be accomodated via a plaform independent API/TOOLKIT/SDK
We are of the mind that it is about time that such project and group
be form to deal with these issues.
We want to setup a repository where these files may be access such as
Simte20 and start putting together a OTG FAQ.
If you have some or any information that in your opinion would be 
of interest to the OTG community and you like to see included in our
first FAQ please send it email to the address below.
 
Thanks in Advance

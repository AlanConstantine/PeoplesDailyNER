                                for the
                          OPEN  TELEMATIC GROUP
 
                                  OTG
 
 
 
 
I have proposed the forming of a consortium/task force for the promotion
of NAPLPS/JPEG, FIF to openly discuss ways, method, 
procedures,algorythms,
applications, implementation, extensions of NAPLPS/JPEG standards.
These standards should facilitate the creation of REAL_TIME Online
applications that make use of Voice, Video, Telecommuting, HiRes 
graphics,
Conferencing, Distant Learning, Online order entry, Fax,in addition
these dicussion would assist all to better understand how SGML,CALS,
ODA,MIME,OODBMS,JPEG,MPEG,FRACTALS,SQL,CDrom,cdromXA,Kodak PhotoCD,TCL,
V.FAST,EIA/TIA562,can best be incorporated and implemented to
develop TELEMATIC/Multimedia applications....
 
We want to be able to support DOS, UNIX, MAC, WINDOWS, NT, OS/2 
platforms.
It is our hope that individuals,developers, corporations, Universities,
R & D labs would join in in supporting such an endeavor.
 
This would be a NOT_FOR_PROFIT group with bylaws and charter. Already 
many
corporation have decided to support OTG (Open TELEMATIC Group) so do not 
delay joining if you are a developer
 
An RFD has been posted to form a usenet newsgroup and a FAQ will soon be 
be compose to start promulgating what is known on the subject.
If you would like to be added to the mailist send email or mail to
the address below. 
 
This group would publish an electronic quarterly NAPLPS/JPEG newsletter
as well as a hardcopy version.
We urge all who wants to see CMCs HiRes based applications
& the NAPLPS/JPEG G R O W,  decide to join and mutually benefit from 
this NOT-FOR_PROFIT endeavor.
 
NOTE: Telematic has been defined by Mr. James Martin as the marriage
      of Voice, Video, Hi-res Graphics, Fax, IVR, Music over telephone
      lines/LAN.

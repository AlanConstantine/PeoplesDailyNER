I have not seen articles in comp.graphics.research for a long time.
Does it/he work anymore?

I have seen many conference related postings in comp.graphics,
and it is hard to believe that people have not tried to post them to
c.g.research.

If somebody has not got his article to comp.graphics.research, then
write to me or post here.

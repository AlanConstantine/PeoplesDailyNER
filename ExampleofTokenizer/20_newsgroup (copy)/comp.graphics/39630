I'm having a slight problem with the POV raytracer.  I'm not sure if
this is the correct group to post to or not.  I create .tga files on
a unix machine using pov.  Then when i download them to display on my pc,
they're listed as bad files.  But when I create the file on my pc, it displays
fine.  Are unix .tga's incompatible with the pc?  An easy solution to this
problem would be a unix targa->gif converter.  Anyone know where I could
find one?  Any help on this subject is appreciated.

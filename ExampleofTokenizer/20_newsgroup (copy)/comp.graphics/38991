vamilliron:  Yes, Intel's PCI is (another) Local Bus standard, which
can be used for graphics, although I believe Local Buses can be used
for other things, too.  As far as I know, though, PCI Local Bus 
would compete with VESA Local Bus, not the VESA graphics standard, but
others more enlightened might be able to shed more light on this
matter.

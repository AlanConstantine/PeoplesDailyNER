"Advanced Visual Systems will present this technical seminar on
AVS, the world's leading visualization software package.  AVS is
a point and click, module driven, easy-to-use product that
produces full color, two or three dimensional rendered scenes for
interactive observation.  It is supported on all current Unix
RISC platforms from Sun, SGI, IBM, H-P, DG, and DEC.  It also
runs under DEC VMS.

"AVS is in its fourth year on the street and is very mature.  All
fields of science, engineering, medicine, and even business
applications now use AVS.  This seminar will focus on its many
features in technical detail during a half hour slide
presentation.  Following a question period there will be a live
demonstration using a Sun SPARCstation.  In addition, a new AVS
program called CAMPUS will be introduced at this meeting.

"Also discussed will be the International AVS Center, which
provides an on-line repository of over 1000 graphics modules at
the North Carolina Supercomputer Center in Raliegh, NC.  AVS has
imbedded tools to write one's own customized modules should these
not be available with AVS or from AVS International."

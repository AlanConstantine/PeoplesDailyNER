Hi,

I'm hoping someone out there will be able to help our computer science
project group. We are doing computer science honours, and our project
is to do a 'graphical simulator for a finite state automata'.

Basically, the program must draw a diagram of a FSA from a textual grammar,
showing circles for states, and labeled arc's in-between.

The problem is working out the best way to layout the states, and draw the
arc's in-between so that as few arc's as possible cross each other.

If anyone has any suggestions/algorithms/bug-free ready to compile C code :) 
that might help us, it would be much appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

Gregory

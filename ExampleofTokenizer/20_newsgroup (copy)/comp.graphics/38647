I have a researcher who collecting electical impulses from
the human heart through a complex Analog to Digital system
he has designed and inputting this information into his EISA
bus HP Vectra Computer running DOS and the Phar Lap DOS extender. 

He want to purchase a very high-performance video card for
3-D modeling. He is aware of a company called Matrox but
he is concerned about getting married to a company and their
video routine library. He would hope some more flexibility:
to choose between several card manufacturers with a standard
video driver. He would like to write more generic code- 
code that could be easily moved to other cards or computer operating
systems in the future. Is there any hope?
Any information would be greatly appreciated-
Please, if possible, respond directly to internet mail 
to raymaker@bcm.tmc.edu

Thanks

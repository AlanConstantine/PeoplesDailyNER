I am looking for some fast polygon routines (Shaded or Texture
Mapped) in ASM (compile with MASM) or in Turbo Pascal (compile with
TP6). It has to be able to run on a 286, but does not have to look
super fast on a 286, but must look good on a 386.  

If anyone has any such code could you please mail it to me. Or tell
me where it can be got. 

Thanks in advance.

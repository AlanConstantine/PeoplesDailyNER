I have a lots of .cgm files produced by NCAR Graph Utility V3.00.

They are all color graphs, and I want to print them out. 

The printers I own are Postscript, and HP 7475a. Anyone who have 

experiences in this please tell me, e-mail me will be very nice.

Or if someone knows how to convert those .cgm  files into .gif

pcx, .bmp .... , it will helps a lot.

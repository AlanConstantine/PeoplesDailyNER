Greetings all.
	According to a FAQ I read, on 30 July 1992, Joshua C. Jensen posted an 
article on bitmap manipulation (specifically, scaling and perspective) to the 
newsgroup rec.games.programmer. (article 7716)
	The article included source code in Turbo Pascal with inline assembly 
language.

	I have been unable to find an archive for this newsgroup, or a current 
email address for Joshua C. Jensen.
	If anyone has the above details, or a copy of the code, could they 
please let me know.	Many thanks.
					Yours gratefully, etc.  Myles.

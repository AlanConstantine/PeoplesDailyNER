In the UIBM PC world, how much of a "standard" has VESA become for
SVGA graphics?  I know there are lots of graphics-board companies out 
there, as well as several graphics chips manufacturers- are they adhering to
the VESA standard, and what effect is/will the VESA Local Bus have on all
of this?
Anyone?

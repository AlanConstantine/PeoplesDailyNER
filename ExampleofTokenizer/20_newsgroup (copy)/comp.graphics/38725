I'm planning to buy a new VLB/EISA system with a good graphic performance.
So far I looked at the ATI GUP VLB as my favorite graphics-card. But 
recently I heard something about a new card from  Miro. It was the Miro
Crystal 24s with 3 MB and True Color support up to 1024x768. It costs just a
little more than the ATI. So, can't decide which one matches better my needs.
Any technical references and performance comparisons (especially from the
Miro card) would be greatly appreciated.

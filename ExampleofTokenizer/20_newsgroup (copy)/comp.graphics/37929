Hi,

I'm interested in writing a program to generate a SIRD picture, you know
the stereogram where you cross your eyes and the picture becomes 3D.

Does anyone have one or know where I can get one?

Please e-mail to steveq@sndcrft.DIALix.oz.au with any replies.

Many thanks for your help.

Steve Q.

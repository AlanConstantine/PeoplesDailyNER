I have some color gifs which I would like to archive in a much smaller
size using a grayscale palette of 16 shades. The quantization to 16 grays
introduces some ugly bands in the pictures, which can be nicely eliminated
by dithering. Up to now I have used XV to process the images, but now I
would like to automate the procedure.

The problem is that XV can't (I think) convert images automatically, and the
obvious alternative PNMPLUS (PPMQUANT and PNMDITHER) don't even get close to
XV's quality. PNMDITHER apparently dithers in RGB, even though the images
are in grayscale. The dithering routine in XV seems to use the natural image
colors for the dither. Is this or any similar routine available in the
public domain? If so, where?

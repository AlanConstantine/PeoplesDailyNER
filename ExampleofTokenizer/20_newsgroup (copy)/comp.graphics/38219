It is used to create a TIN (triangulated irregular network), which is
basically a bunch of triangles which form a surface over a group of
points.  What is special about it is that the triangles formed are the 
most equalateral possible.  Check out "Proceedings of AutoCarto N" where
N is 8..10.  Sorry, I don't have a specific reference describing the
process.

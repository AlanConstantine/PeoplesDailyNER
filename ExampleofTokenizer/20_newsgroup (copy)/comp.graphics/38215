I usually use "Algorithms for graphics and image processing" by
Theodosios Pavlidis, but other people here got them same idea and now
3 of 4 copies in the libraries have been stolen!

Another reference is "Digital Image Processing" by Gonzalez and
Wintz/Wood, which is widely available but a little expensive ($55
here- I just checked today).

We have heard many bad things about the ATI Ultra Plus card (mainly having
to do with its buggy Windows drivers).

I would like to replace by ATI Graphics Ultra with a true-colour accelerated
card. I was about to buy the ATI Ultra Plus (EISA) but it has had so much
bad press that I am reconsidering.


I would like an accelerated card
             a card that does 24bit true colour at 800x600 at least
             a card that does 1024x758 at 256 colours (or more)
             a card that has fast polygon fills
             a card that has fast bit blits
             a card that has a robust windows driver
             a card that has high speed non-interlaced refresh

Any suggestions?

My app requires lots of 3d poly grahics and complexing true colour
imaging.  I would sure like a faster solution that what I have now.

Thanks,

Al

	I am unable to run Quicktime 1.5 on my IIvx running System 7.1, and
	I don't know why. (If there is a better group to post this to, please
	let me know.) Quicktime 1.0 works fine, but when I try to run a movie
	in any application that supports it, Like Simple Player, Canvas or
	Word, I get the message "sorry a system error occurred '<Application>'
	unimplemented trap <continue> <restart>", I press <continue> and get
	"The application 'unknown' has unexpectedly quit, because an error of
	type 12 occurred." Substitute Simple Player or Canvas or Word for
	'<Application>, and the messages are always the same. If I restart with
	Quicktime 1.0, I have no problems. Any suggestions? I am at a loss.
		Thanks in advance. Oh yah, please email me as I don't check
		the newsgroups very often.

I have a similiar question relating to anti-alaising that my friend has asked
to have posted to the more knowledgable in this group. I'm sorry if this is
an FAQ.

   "What anti-alaising methods do Persistance Of Vision & Polyray use?"

Thank you in advance. You can either email me or reply (or flame me if it is
an FAQ :-) )

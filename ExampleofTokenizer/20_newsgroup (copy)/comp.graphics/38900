Does anyone know how to decode the color information of a NTSC signal ?

I need to convert this data to RGB for a Video Capture Utility I am 
writing for use with an IBM M-MOTION Video adapter card...

I need to know the how the V and U signals work in the color process.

Thanks in advance for any information or algorythms etc.

Later-

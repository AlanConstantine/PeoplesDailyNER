I'm looking for a database called "Micro World Data Bank II", a database
with digital map information containing 178,068 latitude, longitude points.
It is said to be in the public domain. If anyone knows a place where I can
get it (preferably FTP/gopher/mailserver etc.; otherwise snail mail) please
let me know. I you have it yourself and are willing to send me the file,
drop me a line.

I'll be using it with a program called VERSAMAP by Charles H. Culberson.
If anyone knows of another detailed database that can be used with this
program (preferably PD), I would be very interested.

Replies by e-mail please, directly to me, I don't read this group regularly.
If there's interest I'll post a summary, of course.

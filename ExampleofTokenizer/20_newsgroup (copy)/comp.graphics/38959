There are several CRT-to-film writers around. Agfa has some, they also might
be called Matrix?, and I am pretty sure other companies sell the same
equipment. You might want to talk to any company in your area that does
presentation slides or offers graphics services. They should have those
machines and they might point you to a local vendor. From there on it's all
a question of money. They units are essentially high res CRTs plus a filter
wheel plus a 35mm camera and a computer hook-up.

p.s. I am currently shooting my slides for my next talk on one of the Agfa
machines.

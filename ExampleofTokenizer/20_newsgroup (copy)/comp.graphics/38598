'Illumination and Color in Computer Generated Imagery' by Roy Hall contains c
source for several famous illumination models, including Bouknight, Phong,
Blinn, Whitted, and Hall illumination models. If you want an introduction to
shading you might look through the book 'Writing a Raytracer' edited by
Glassner. Also, the book 'Procedural elements for Computer Graphics' by Rogers
is a good reference. Source for code in these book are available on the net i 
believe, you might check out nic.funet.fi or some site closer to you carrying 
graphics related stuff. 

Hope this is what you were asking for.

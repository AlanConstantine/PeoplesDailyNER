           Cornell Theory Center Summer School
 
          Offered through the Cornell School of
        Continuing Education and Summer Sessions
 
                  Course Description
 
 Within the past ten years, the  simulation and  modeling of

molecules has evolved from an esoteric academic subject into
a  international  industry. Computer  graphics has played  a
decisive role in this transformation by allowing chemists to
build, visualize and interact with complex geometrical objects.
 
While computer scientists are conversant in the language of their
own discipline, they are often unfamiliar with the terminology,
simulation techniques and practical needs of research chemists.
Similarly, chemists are often unfamiliar with the latest paradigms
and technological advances in graphical computing.
 
This interdisciplinary course is intended to bridge the gap
between computer science and chemistry and to equip chemistry
researchers who wish to be more than just casual users of
prepackaged graphics software. Although this is not intended to
be a course in computational chemistry or drug design, data sets
from chemical research problems will be used in lab and students
will be encouraged to bring data sets of their own. Lab exercises
and projects will be carried out using data-flow programming
(IBM Visualization Data Explorer software) and students will have
access to Cornell Theory Center computing resources, including video
recording equipment.
 
Audience:  researchers and students in the chemical and biological
           sciences interested in integrating state-of-the-art
           computer graphics into their research; computer scientists
           wishing to gain familiarity with a major application of
           scientific visualization.
 
           The class size will be limited to 25 participants on a
           first-come first-served basis.
 
Level:     Graduate/advanced undergraduate, 1 or 2 Credits. May be taken
           without credit as a workshop. Calculus, linear algebra
           and introductory chemistry required. Familiarity with Unix,
           X-windows and C is useful but not required.
 
Date:   June 14-25, 1993  (2 Credits)
        June 14-18, 1993  (1 or 0 credits)
 
Time:   Mon-Fri 9:00 am to 12:00 pm and 1:00 pm to 4:00 pm
 
Cost:   0 or 1 credit       $410
        2 credits           $820
 
Format
 
The course will be held in the Theory Center training facility
where computer workstations will be available.  Daily lectures will be
interspersed with laboratory exercises and ample time will be provided
for project enablement and familiarization with the new computing
environment. Students enrolled for one credit will be graded on the basis
of their laboratory exercises and short final project. Those enrolled
for a second credit will receive more advanced lectures, be given
more time for project development and meet daily to share experience
and discuss problems encountered.
 
Content (may vary)
 
    Elements of computer graphics
         polygonal rendering, lighting models, ray tracing, volumetric
         rendering, stereo graphics, animation, introduction to data-flow
         programming (DX), interactivity.
 
    Representing the atom
         size, time and energy scales
         basic classical and quantum mechanics
 
    Important categories of molecules
         small molecules, biopolymers, surfaces and catalysts,
         miscellaneous current applications
 
    Data formats and conversions
 
    Advanced molecular graphics techniques
 
    Types of simulation and experiment
         electronic structure, molecular dynamics/mechanics
         electrostatics, X-ray crystallography, NMR, quantum
         dynamics and spectroscopy.
 
Instructors
 
The course will be taught by two instructors. Topics related to computer
graphics will be handled by Dr. Bruce Land, Project Leader of Visualization,
Cornell National Supercomputing Facility. Chemistry-specific aspects
of the course will be handled by Dr. Richard E. Gillilan, Visualization
Specialist and Research Scientist, Cornell National Supercomputing Facility

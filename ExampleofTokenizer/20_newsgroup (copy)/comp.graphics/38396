The most ridiculous example of VR-exploitation I've seen so far is the
"Virtual Reality Clothing Company" which recently opened up in Vancouver. As
far as I can tell it's just another "chic" clothes spot. Although it would be
interesting if they were selling "virtual clothing"....

E-mail me if you want me to dig up their phone # and you can probably get
some promotional lit.

I am applying for an NSF grant to buy equipment for a laboratory...

The lab will need to support C (or Pascal) with graphics tools...


We can run the lab either on PC's or  DEC equipment --- 



If you are familiar with appropriate products (software/hardware) and precise
prices. Please contact


shai@lcc.stonehill.edu


We are interested in any available acadmic discounts....


Also, if anyone runs a lab using similar software/hardware, I would be very
interested in hearing your opinions of its success

Thanks

  I've talked with Mark and he faxed some literature, though it wasn't very helpful-
  just a list of routine names: _BSplineSurface, _DrawString3D... 241 names.
  There was a Product Info sheet that explained some of the package capabilities.
  I also found a review in April/May '92 MacTutor.

  It does look like a good package. The current price is $295 US.

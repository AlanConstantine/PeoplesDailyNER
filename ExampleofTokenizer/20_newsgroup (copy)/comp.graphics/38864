I've discovered a bug in the libraries/parser/parser.c loadcolour function where it was generating a segmentation fault.  It appears the colourList[] is geting corrupted somehow.  I had it return random colours instead and everything worked great (except for a few colour problems) so I know its the only thing wrong.

The colour table somehow gets a couple of nulls placed in it so when the "name" of the colours are compared it crashes.  I haven't found the problem yet maybe someone else can.

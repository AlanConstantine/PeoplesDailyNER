Hello, I realize that this might be a FAQ but I have to ask since I don't get a
change to read this newsgroup very often.  Anyways for my senior project I need
to convert an AutoCad file to a TIFF file.  Please I don't need anyone telling
me that the AutoCAD file is a vector file and the TIFF is a bit map since I
have heard that about 100 times already I would just like to know if anyone
knows how to do this or at least point me to the right direction.

Any help greatly appreciated,
Matt Georgy

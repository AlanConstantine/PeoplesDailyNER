This doesn't sound right to me.  I have an ATI Ultra Pro VLB card with 2MB
VRAM, and I'm pretty sure it is not interlaced at 800x600 in 24bit mode.  I'm
at work right now so I can't check it out, but I know that when I set it up
the utility let me specify non-interlaced for this mode.  And I haven't 
noticed it the couple times that I have put the card in this mode in windows,
but I could be wrong because I very rarely use this mode.  For most of my
applications at home 1024x768x16bpp is what I use.

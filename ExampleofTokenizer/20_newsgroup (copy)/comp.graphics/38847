Hello,

Thanks to the people who helped me with the problem of
displaying 24 bit images. All the viewers like xli,
xloadimage and display are converting the 24 bit images
to 8 bit before display them on the screen.

What I really want is a viewer with make use of the 24 bit
frame/screen buffer (in our case, the Parallax one).

Thanks in advance.

Gilles

PS:  We are using a Sun Sparc running X11.

   Hey,

   I am looking for C-algorithm, which decide,whether a 3D-Point is
   inside a space which was defined by 8 x 3D-points.
   With a space defined by 8 x 3D-points, I mean a space defined by
   6 closed 3D meshes defined by 8 points. Like this :

              _____
             /    /|
            /____/ |
            |    | |
            |    | /
            |____|/


   But in this simple example, the sides are parallel, but my problem,
   the sides can be non parallel and the opposite sides must not have
   the same size etc. Please mail me your informations !

   Thanks for your great efforts

      Oliver

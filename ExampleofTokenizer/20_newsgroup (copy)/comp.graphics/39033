"Only"?!?  That's a long time! (echoing above posting)  The way the market
is going nowadays, your machine's obsolete two weeks before you buy it. 
Sounds like you'll have to sink *some* money into it for repair, but
that's sometimes necessary for equipment.

: Is that a reasonable life
: cycle for a LCD display?

I think 21 months with nothing wrong until now is quite reasonable.  If
you had bought a Compaq or Toshiba, you might have reasonably expected the
machine to last longer before something went wrong; but that's a moot
point, perhaps.

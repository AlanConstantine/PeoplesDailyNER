Yes, there are serveral programs which can convert font files (eq the Borland
fonts) to objects consisting of spheres, cones etc. 
I've used a program (forgot its name/place, but i can look for it) which
converted these Borland fonts to three different raytracers. Vivid, POV and
Polyray (which i like more (more flexibel/faster/use of expressions etc).
The program has a lot nice features.
So if interested give me a mail.

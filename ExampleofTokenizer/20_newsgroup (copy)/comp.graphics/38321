I'm a mac user who wants to use some of the rayshade models I've built
using macrayshade (rayshade-M) with Stratavision 3d.  Since Stratavision
can import many different model files I thought this would be a cinch...
but I haven't been able to find a simple translator that will work on the
mac.  Any ideas?

Stratavision 3d should be able to import:

DXF
MiniCAD
Super 3d
Swivel 3d professional

out of the box and:

RIB
IGS

with externals.

Also, if anyone knows of any other translator externals available for
Stratavision 3d (esp. Rayshade!) please e-mail me!

BTW, I'm going to send mail to the rayshade usrs mailing list tomorrow (I
misplaced the address) but since most users of rayshade do not seem to
operate with macs, I'm not getting my hopes up...

thanks in advance,

--patrick.                hurh@fnal.fnal.gov

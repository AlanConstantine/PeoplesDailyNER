I am trying to convert an m-motion (IBM) video file format YUV to RGB 
data...

THE Y portion is a byte from 0-255
THE V is a byte -127-127
THe color is U and V
and the intensity is Y

DOes anyone have any ideas for algorhtyms or programs ?

Can someone tell me where to get info on the U and V of a television signal ?

IF you need more info reply at the e-mail address...
Basically what I am doing is converting a digital NTSC format to RGB (VGA)
for displaying captured video pictures.

Thanks.


THE U is a byte -127-127

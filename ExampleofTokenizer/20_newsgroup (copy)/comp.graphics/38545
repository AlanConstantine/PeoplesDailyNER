   At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in
his note-book, called out "Silence!" and read out from his book
"Rule Forty-two. All persons more than a mile high to leave the court."
   Everybody looked at Alice.
   "I'm not a mile high," said Alice.
   "You are," said the King.
   "Nearly two miles high," added the queen.
   "Well, I sha'n't go, at any rate," said Alice; "besides, that's not
a regular rule: you invented it just now."
   "It's the oldest rule in the book," said the King.
   "Then it ought to be Number One," said Alice.

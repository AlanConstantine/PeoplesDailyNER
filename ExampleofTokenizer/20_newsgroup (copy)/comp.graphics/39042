Subject: Direct Acess to Video memory
Lines: 12

      Hi.  I'm  looking for information on how to directly manipulate
 video memory.  I have an application that I would like to use this for,
 because it is much faster than going through the BIOS.  I know that
 video memory ispart of the system area above the first 640K, so I guess
 I am looking to find out exactly what section of memory it is, and how it
 is layed out.     Thanks.

           Regards,       Gordon Rogers

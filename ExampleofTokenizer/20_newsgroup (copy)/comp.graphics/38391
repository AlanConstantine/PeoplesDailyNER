Howdy all,

	I was wondering if people could e-mail me their opinions on
the various graphics viewers available for MS-Windows 3.x...  I'm
working on a project to set up our scanner and write documentation on
how to use it and it would be nice to have a snazzy image viewer 
to look at (and maybe even edit?) the image you just scanned.

The file formats I'm looking for:

GIF
JPEG
TIFF
PCX
whatever other 'major' file formats there are.

Thanks a lot for your help

Grant

I need a graphics display program that can take as a parameter the name of
the file to be displayed, then just display that image and then quit.

All of the other graphics display programs come up with a menu first or some
other silliness.

This program is going to be run from within another program.  I have lots of
memory and VGA color.  Any graphics format will do.  Has anyone heard of such
a beast?

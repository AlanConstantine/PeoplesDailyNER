Does ANYONE out there in Net-land have any information on the Cobra 2.20 
card?  The sticker on the end of the card reads
        Model: Cobra 1-B-1
        Bios:  Cobra v2.20

I Havn't been able to find anything about it from anyone!  If you have 
any information on how to get a hold of the company which produces the 
card or know where any drivers are for it, PLEASE let me know!

As far as I can tell, it's a CGA card that is taking up 2 of my 16-bit 
ISA slots but when I enable the test patterns, it displays much more than 
the usualy 4 CGA colors... At least 16 from what I can count.. Thanks!

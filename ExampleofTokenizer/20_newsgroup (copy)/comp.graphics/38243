I would like to know if anyone has had any luck using the upper 128 ASCII
characters on a Sun station.  I am trying to convert a fortran program to run
on a Sun.  When we write character buffers to the Sun which contain char(218)
or char(196) or char(197) etc.  We get characters on the screen but they are
not the characters in the standard ASCII tables.

Any ideas or help will be appreciated.

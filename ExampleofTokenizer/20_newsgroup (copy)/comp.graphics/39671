Hello
	I have posted to this newsgroup once before and recieved a
moderately helpful response on a couple of issues. This I appreciated very
much . I would however like to know why it is that ther is simply NO 
information out there on some subjects for the relativly novice graphics
programmer. The subjects are

	1) How do you access the extra video memory on a video board. I
know somwhere there aresome standard video bios calls that allow you to
dothis. I have 1meg of memory on my board and according to all the books
and info I have read I am only (at maximum) using 256k of it. There is a
way to do this in standard VGA cause I have seen vidoe paging (written in
assembly, which I don't know) written into apps hat use mode 13h. To get
any speed at all you have to do this. How do I do it?

	2) The vesa standard. What gives here. I have read most of what
the net has to offer on VESA and as far as coding for VESA goes most of
the advice is cryptic at best. Where do I get public domain info that will
tell me in "mostly plain" english how the vesa calls work.

	My biggest gripe is about number 1. I have bought graphics books,
I have asked graphics professors, I have hunted the net through both
gopher, and archie, I ahave asked apps programmers and it is like there is
some lock on this information. Graphics programming books tell alot of
programmiing algorithm information, but they always fall short of telling
you how to really control the video bios. What are all the calls folks, I
know there are people out there that know how to doall tis stuff. Where
are you, and why haven't you written a book yet? 

Please help

Thanks in advance

[ ..see previous article on this debate for the rests.. ]

I can see XV-3.00 agree with my view in cases you don't -- even I say
my personal opinion (as above), it doesn't mean that it is not most
obvious thing.
Please, if you use my previous writings as contradicting argument,
please do read them -- you have not saw them at all; you just
refered to text from which I wrote 'something' -- and you make
hard decisions from that, without reading what exactly I have written.

It is really hard read when one writes a reply line by line method
and don't understand include previously written material with the new
sentences to give them meaning. You seem to be one such.

You also start replying to my articles, even you don't understand what
is going on; you ask me repeatedly to decsribe my views what were
wrong with XV 2.21 even I posted them within the article you did reply
to. Believe me, it is not nice to get flamed specially when I know
that you have not read my article carefully in the first place.

XV-3.00 and JPEG FAQ and users I have written to agree me with the
places you didn't; I'm sure you just didn't undertand what about I
wrote. We can blame my writing skills (in English?) for that, or?

Better stop the discussion and check what new ideas XV-3.00 gives;
I allready mailed one to Bradley...

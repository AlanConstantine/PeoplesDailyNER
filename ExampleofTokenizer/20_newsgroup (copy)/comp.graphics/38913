Hello,

I am interested to hear from people working in the field of visual
simulation, ie driving simulation, flight simulation etc.
Would be very pleased to see, what is going on in the field of research
and industrial development.

For those of you interested as well: There is a workshop (preferedly 
held in German), situated in Wuppertal, November 18/19 1993, specially
related to the above topic.
The title:

"Sichtsysteme - Visualisierung in der Simulationstechnik"

Complete details are available. Please contact me.

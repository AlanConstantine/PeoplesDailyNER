  For a commerical package try WAVE from  Precision Visuals
                                           505-530-6563

  For a free package try KHOROS from University of New Mexico
                                      508-277-6563
                                   ftp from
                              ptrg.eece.unm.edu

    Login in anonyomus or ftp  with a valid email address as the password
               cd /pub/khoros/release

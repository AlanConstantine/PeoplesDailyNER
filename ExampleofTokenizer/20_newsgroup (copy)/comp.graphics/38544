I have the ATI Ultra Pro local bus with 2MB VRAM, and I am perfectly happy with
the Windows drivers (currently using version 59).  It does everything you
mention below, but also does 1024x768x16bpp true color.  As a matter of
fact it also supports high refresh 1280x1024 at 256 colors.  The performance
is great.

Supposedly the new Matrox Ultra-something-or-other actually does some
3d rendering (at least has some hardware support for Z).  Good luck in
your search.

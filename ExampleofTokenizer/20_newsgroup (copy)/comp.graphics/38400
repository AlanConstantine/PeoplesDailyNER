Sensing.

Dr. Phillip K. Robertson, CSIRO Division of Information Technology,
Canberra on Interactive Visualisation.


   The conference will concentrate on (but is not limited to) the
following areas of image processing:-

                * Computer Vision and Object Recognition
                * Motion Analysis
                * Morphology
                * Medical Imaging
                * Fuzzy logic and Neural Networks
                * Image Coding

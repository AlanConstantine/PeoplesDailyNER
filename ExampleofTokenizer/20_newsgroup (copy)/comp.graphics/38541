What kind of polygons?  Shaded?  Texturemapped?  Hm?  More comes into play with
fast routines than just "polygons".  It would be nice to know exaclty what
system (VGA is a start, but what processor?) and a few of the specifics of the
implementation.  You need to give  more info if you want to get any answers! :P

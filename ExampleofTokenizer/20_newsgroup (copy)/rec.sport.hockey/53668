Here are my predictions (try not to laugh hysterically)
Somebody save this so I can laugh when I win my own pool.
I don't have prizes, but we all love BRAGGING RIGHTS, so winner takes them.

Also.  If somebody has some sort of scoring system let me know.
I was thinking 1 for 1st round victories, 2 for second, 3 for 3rd, 4 for 4th
But we may get alot of ties.  Any ideas?

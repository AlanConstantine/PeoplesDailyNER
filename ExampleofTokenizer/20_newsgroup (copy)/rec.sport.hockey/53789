During the regular season, when the intensity is down, not many teams
have forwards who will continually go and park themselves in front of
the opposing teams net...and the inadequacy of the Leafs defense in
this regard thus didn't matter...however, the playoffs are a different
story...every good team is going to have players who are going to
become potted plants in front of Potvin...and the Leafs relatively
unphysical defensive core will finally be exposed as weak an inept.

Hard work will go a long way during the regular season...almost
to 100 points...and the Leafs deserve credit for that...but in the 
playoffs talent matters, because everyone begins working hard.

Yes, it's a shame that the NHL lost a fine team in one of the best
hockey markets in the country.  Being a North Stars fan, it is sad to
see all of the tradition of the last 26 years get thrown into oblivion
at the hands of a truly crappy owner.

Hopefully the NHL will install an expansion franchise in the Twin Cities
within the next five years.  Even if this is the case, a lot has been
lost in the North Stars move...

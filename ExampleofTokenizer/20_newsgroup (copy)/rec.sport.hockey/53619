I got back from my trip to discover that my email spool file got blown
away.  I am missing all the playoff pool entries sent between April 5
and April 17.  It looks like about 200 entries got lost.  *Sigh*.

Therefore, I would like to ask each person that sent me a team to resend
it ASAP.  I am relying on your honesty to not make changes after the
deadline today.

Thanks in advance, and I apologize for the problem.

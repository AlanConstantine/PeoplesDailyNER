It is indeed nice to have fans that are concerned about the dearth of
disputatious dissertation linked to my hiatus.  Have simply been too
damned busy lately to keep you lads and lassies entertained.  You can
be sure, however, that I will somehow manage to find time to woof if 
the Leafs give just cause. 

And let's all try to keep people's names (especially mine) out of the
subject headers.  I, for one, neither seek nor enjoy such a cheap form
of notoriety.

One thing you can be assured of, however, is this: the Leafs are the
best of all the teams in the league that have allowed 12 goals in 2 
games.

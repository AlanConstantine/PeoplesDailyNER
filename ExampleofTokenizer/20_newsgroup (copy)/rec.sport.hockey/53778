Luc Robitaille was captain of the Kings the first third of the season,
until The Great One came back from his disc injury. It was kind of
awkward, but Melrose appointed (anointed?) TGO as captain immediately upon
his return, after which he did not score a goal for something like 10
games.

I think Luc should have remained Captain all season.

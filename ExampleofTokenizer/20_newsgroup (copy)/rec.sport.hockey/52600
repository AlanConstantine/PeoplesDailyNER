You know, you're absolutely right.  I think we should round up all those
players of European descent and ship 'em back to where they came from.  Let's
see, with whom should we start?  I dunno, Lemieux?  Hmmm...sounds like he
has *French* blood in him!!!  Hey!  France is part of Europe!  Send that
Euro-blooded boy back!!!

Sheesh.

I don't think it would be hard to find some Native Americans (or Native
Canadians, for that matter) who would dispute your claim to this great 
continent of *ours.*  Ya see, if you believe the anthropologists, we're *all*
immigrants of some sort.  If you really don't think that Mogilny, Bure,
Selanne, et al have improved the NHL, then I'm not sure you understand the
game.

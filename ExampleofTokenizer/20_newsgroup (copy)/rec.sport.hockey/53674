Perhaps it was Trottier.  It happened behind the Habs goal if I recall.
Gainey simply didn't have his head up as he was picking up the puck.

If Gilmour was taken completely by surprise, as Gainey was, then yeah,
I would have to say that Doug wasn't playing "technically" smart 
hockey.  In any case, to claim as Greg did, that Gainey *never* made 
a technical mistake is absolutely ludicrous.

Good for you.  You'd only be displaying your ignorance of course, but to 
each his own...

>I think Gainey would be honoured to know that you've included him

I think Gainey should feel honoured to know that he is remembered at 
all.

>about what wins a hockey game...pluggers are an integral part of

Certainly pluggers are an integral part of any team.  And that is
simply because there are not enough solid two-way players to go 
around.  Who would you rather have as your "checking" centre?  Doug
Gilmour or Doug Jarvis?  For that matter I would take either Gretzky
or Mario as my "checking" centres.  Do you think Gretzky could cover
Bob Gainey?

You're wrong again.  The Selke is awarded to the forward that does the
best job defensively and this may or may not be the best plugger.  If 
Gilmour does the best defensive job in the league I don't see why he 
should be out of the running simply because he also contributes offen-
sively.

Settle down?  If you think that I have likened the Selke to the Nobel
prize then I suggest that you had best "settle down".  And if you are
going to try to put words in my mouth, let me suggest that you "settle 
down" before you bother following up on my postings.

You might consider developing your own style.  After all, imitation is 
the sincerest form of flattery and I am quite sure that flattery is not 
your intention.

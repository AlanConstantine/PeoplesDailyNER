Well, suffice to say that it is a sport for those able to make the
substantial investment in equipment, etc. But here's something, do 
you think that the availability of in-line skates and road hockey
could contribute to a rise in awareness of ice hockey? I would
argue this is having an effect here. Kids play ice hockey in the
winter and road hockey in the summer with in-line skates.

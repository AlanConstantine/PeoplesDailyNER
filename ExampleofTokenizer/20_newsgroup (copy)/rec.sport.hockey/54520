And Fleury is no enforcer. An agitator for sure, but Fleury never has and never
will have a fight, which seems to be what you're saying Wood is. 

The closest Fleury ever came to fighting was a game two years ago against
Los Angeles. There was a scrum and McSorley pinched Fleury's head under his
arm. Fleury dropped his gloves and gave McSorley a weak shot to the side of the
head. McSorely, knowing a good thing when he saw one, popped Fleury one right
between the eyes. End of fight. Fleury got ten stitches for his trouble.

The only player I can ever see Theo fighting is Cliff Ronning, and even then
he'd be giving up two inches and 10-15 pounds. :-)

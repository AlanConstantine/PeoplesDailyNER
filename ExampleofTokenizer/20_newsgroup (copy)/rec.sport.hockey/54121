What actually happened.  After the Pens game, i turned to ESPN and the game
was nearly at the end of regular, then the phone rang.  I turened off the 
TV - later when i turned it back on, the Indians were on...  Then a
little later, the hockey games was on again, then the baseball game...
what was actually on - not that it matters any more, but some hockey was
in deed on...

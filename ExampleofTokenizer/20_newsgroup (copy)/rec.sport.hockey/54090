Have no fear, Doug, the Bruins are toast. Statistically, only 2 teams 
in **all** the Stanley Cup series ever played have come back to win. 
And it couldn't have happened to a nicer team, with all the crowing 
from Boston fans I've had to endure over the last month. 

Take heart, Bruins fans. At least you finished first in the Adams 
<sinister chuckle>.

Could someone post the Flyers record with and without Eric Lindros in
the lineup


I have a guy that is trying to compare the Quebec/Flyers trade to the 

Dallas/Minnesota trade in the NFL(Hershel Walker)

I just need the stat to back up my point that Eric will be one of the next

great players

thanks

john

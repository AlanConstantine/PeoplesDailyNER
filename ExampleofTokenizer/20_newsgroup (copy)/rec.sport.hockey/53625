Oh yeah, how come Dino could never take the Caps out of the Patrick
Division?  He choked up 3 games to 1 last year and got swept away in
the second round two years ago.  He rarely, if ever, makes it out of the
division.

So are the Islanders, but they can still pull it out.  Vancouver has Winnipeg's
 number, so it really doesn't matter.

 Kings always seem to go at least 6 or 7, they never play a four or five
game serious.  There's a difference between battling it out and pulling it
out, as I take Calgary to pull it out in 7.

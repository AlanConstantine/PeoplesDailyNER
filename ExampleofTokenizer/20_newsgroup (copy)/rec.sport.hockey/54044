IMHO Bowman is the perfect coach for this group of players at 
this time. Johnson was the perfect coach two years ago for his 
group of players. I would say we have been very lucky here in 
Pittsburgh that the order these coaches came in was this one. 
(Excluding the unfortunate circumstances which brought about the 
change.) With the immense talent on the Penguins roster this 
year, a tougher Bowman keeps the egos in check. Johnson on the 
other hand, was able to inspire the younger, inexperienced players 
to new heights. Both coaches have / had different strengths. Both 
of which came at exactly the right time. 

Another person also mentioned that Bowman is the perfect coach 
for this time since nobody can argue with his decisions. How can 
you argue with the coach with the best record in hockey anyway? 
Playing for a great coach like that demands respect which also 
keeps the egos in check. 

Just a couple of ideas.

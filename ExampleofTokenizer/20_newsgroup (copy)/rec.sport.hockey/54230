- I heard a story on the local sports news broadcast in Edmonton.
- Oiler owner Peter Pocklington will be holding a press conference
- next week. While the exact details are not known, it is believed
- to concern the Oiler's future.
-
- Rumour has it that Pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement
- with Copps Collesium in Hamilton. During the press conference,
- Pocklington may announce the deal. It is quite possible that
- the deal may simply be a way to force Edmonton Northlands to
- renegotiate the Oiler lease on the stadium.
-
- Northlands has offered to buy the Oilers for $65 million earlier,
- but the offer was rejected immediately by Pocklington.
-
- As for me, my opinion is divided... Edmonton has been fairly
- supportive of the Oilers. Even though they're a small market
- team, they had many sellouts in the 80s. Even with the problems
- that the team had this year, they still brought in more fans
- than many teams in larger cities did. On the other hand, if
- the team does move, there is no place more deserving than
- Hamilton. Of course, how would that affect the grand
- realignment scheme of Bettman?
-

  Following up on this, the provincial government has been asked by the
Opposition to block any deal that Pocklington is offering to Hamilton.  The
government said that Pock is going nowhere!

  Why don't I believe the government?  Wasn't it Pocklington who wanted to be
Tory leader 9 years ago?

TSN Sportsdesk just reported that the OTTAWA SUN has reported that
Montreal will send 4 players + $15 million including Vin Damphousse 
and Brian Bellows to Phillidelphia, Phillie will send Eric Lindros
to Ottawa, and Ottawa will give it's first round pick to Montreal.
 
If this is true, it will most likely depend on whether or not Ottawa
gets to choose 1st overall.  Can Ottawa afford Lindros' salary?
 
Personally, I can't see Philli giving up Lindros -- for anything.  
They didn't give away that much to Quebec just to trade him away 
again.  Not to mention that Lindros seems to be a *huge* draw in
Phillie -- and that he represents a successful future for the 
franchise.
 
Ottawa may be better off taking the 4 players +$15 from Montreal
for the pick.

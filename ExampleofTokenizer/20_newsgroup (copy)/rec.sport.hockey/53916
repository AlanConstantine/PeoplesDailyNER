I'm in Edmonton, and while that's usually (or at least OFTEN) the case,
here we were "treated" to the actual ABC telecast of the Kings/Flames
game.  I'm with whoever said it earlier - Don Witless (er, Whitman) is
a poor commentator, and not just for hockey.  Normally, if the Oilers
were still playing (augh), I would turn off the sound and listen to 
the radio broadcast to get decent play-by-play announcing.

But I have to agree.. Boston is a good team..  But streaky...  They put
together a great streak to capture first place in the Adams, but for what?

They have lost the home ice advantage for at least the first round, and might
not make it out of it.

I would love to see the Sabres win the first round, even though I bet on the
Bruins (a 12-pack).  

Oh well, perhaps I should start betting against the Sabres more often! ;-)

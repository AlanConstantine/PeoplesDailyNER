Personality means something to me.  That is exactly why I like Clement
(and Emrick).  On the other hand, JD is a pompous, bull-headed, arrogant
know-it-all.  He's a real turn-off (which is exactly what I do when he's
on).  One complaint I do have about Clement is that he sometimes talks
too much.  If I wanted that I'd listen to Tim McGarver doing a baseball
game.

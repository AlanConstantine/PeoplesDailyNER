IMO any good player should score on power plays because of the man
advantage.  Very good power play scorers tend to become overrated
because their point totals are inflated by power play points.
+/- tends to expose these overrated players such as Brett Hull,
John Cullen and Dave Andreychuck.

Given the opportunity to play power play consistently, any player can
inflate his totals.

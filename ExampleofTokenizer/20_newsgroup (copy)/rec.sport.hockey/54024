I think a compromise would work; namely honouring personages in 
Conference names, and using geographical references in the divisional 
names.  Although I still do not think the move will draw fans to the
game; IMO it's a cosmetic change that Bettman and the owners _hope_ 
will have an effect.  And it doesn't say much for the mentality of 
anybody it works on, either.

Surprise, I agree totally.  The points system is fine, if everybody at all
times has played the same number of games.  Since this is almost never the
case, winning percentage is the way to go.  I don't particularly care if it 
is an "American" thing either, if it works.

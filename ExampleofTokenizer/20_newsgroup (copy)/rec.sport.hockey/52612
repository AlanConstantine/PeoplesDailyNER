That's why we have expansion - to create more jobs. NHL teams can't afford to
import role players from Europe, they pick the stars but will continue to build
their teams around local players.

I'd *LOVE* to see a European NHL division but can't see it happen for some
time. There's simply not enough fan interest at the moment in several
"crucial" markets like Germany, Italy and France while Sweden and Finland
probably can't afford to shell out $20-$30 for tickets the way
American/Canadian fans do. Call it "the Minnesota North Stars" effect:
Scandinavians do love hockey but we prefer to watch local, inexpensive
hockey to the NHL. The National Hockey League should love the idea, though.
Pan-European TV channels such as Eurosport could bring in the millions the
American networks likely never will pay.

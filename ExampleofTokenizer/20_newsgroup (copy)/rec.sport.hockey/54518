Again I assume this is not just flame bait by Roger, but actually a
truly held opinion.

Thanks.  For speaking for all those who didn't feel it was important
enough to say something themselves.  

I wouldn't say that the letter clearly implies representation of the
views of a group that you belong to.  It represents a subset (that you
don't belong to) of a larger group (which you do, if only because this
isn't a moderated group).

Look, there are several ways to state an opposing viewpoint.  Three
that come to mind are as follows:

1) Say it subtly.  Result: it may not be clear.
2) Say it directly yet politely.  Result: probably it will spark some 
   interesting conversation.
3) Say it directly and obnoxiously.  Result: validity goes right out
   the window.

>I would agree that unwarranted use of said term is entirely immature.

You realize that anything you say can, and most certainly will, be
used against you.

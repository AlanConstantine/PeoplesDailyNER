Come on Boston, where the hell are you? Seven wins in a row and what, choke?

I'd much rather see the Bruins in the Wales Conference finals vs. Pitt than
Buffalo or Quebec, if only because it would be more interesting.  Not that
Buffalo or Quebec can't put up a good fight, but I'd much more enjoy a 7-0
pasteing of the Bruins than the Devils.  You have to feel for Terrerri(sp?).

Ah, well, maybe the Devils will pull it out, or maybe the Pens will lose in
the second round, but if not, I hope the Bruins are there to meet them.

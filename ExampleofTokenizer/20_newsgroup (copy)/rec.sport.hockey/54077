 First of all I think when ESPN covers the game they do a wonderful job, but
 last night I felt the same way. I really hate watching Devils/Pens game. 
 Everyone knows that Devils are going to get their ass kicked, why even 
 bother showing them. I was so bored and these ESPN people don't seem to have
 any brain. After the Sundays and last night games, they are still going to 
 show Devils/Pens on THU and SUN. WHat the hell are they thinking about? I 
 think if they keep it up like this NHL will never get a major network contract.
 I'd rather see Caps/Isls game which is more exciting. 

 Now I just hope all baseball games are rained out on ESPN so atleast
 we can get diffrent hockey games.

Here is something crossposted from the AHL mailing list:			

In a discussion between me and Chris Lerch, the subject of Springfield's 
1st round upset of the Providence Bruins
came up. Chris basically raised the possibility that the AHL 
hierarchy is biased in favor of the Indians. He noted that the offices
for the league are in Spring. and many ex-Indians are working for the AHL.
Furthermore, he also informed me that back a few years ago in the Cup 
finals between Roch and Spring, that the Amerks charged favoritism by the office
and that:

"...there were little questionable things liket he AHL president and
staff attending all games with the Springfield brass, including sitting
in their box for the game in Springfield and, according to the Rochester
media, openly cheering for Springfield."

Certainly this is something that is quite serious if any of this
is true. I don't know if this is anything more than whining on the
part of the Amerks (they have pulled this sort of crap against the
Wings before) but if true, this is somthing that seriously raises
questions about President Jack Butterfield's leadership.

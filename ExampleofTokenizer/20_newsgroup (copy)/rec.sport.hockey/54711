Devorski unfortunately helped to taint an otherwise brilliant display
by MacLean.  The Canucks tied up the Jets so tightly that I thought that
they were mailing them.

BTW, Greg...next time, don't fall asleep in geography class, it's pretty
sad when a fellow in Norway can spell Winnipeg properly and a guy in
North America can't.

One more thing...how LONG has Vancouver been in the NHL?  How many
championships do they have?  

Oh yeah...and I CAN go to the Arena and see not one, not two, but
*six* championship banners hanging from the rafters.  3 Stanley Cup
banners, and 3 Avco Cup banners.  My NHL guide says that Vancouver has
won the Cup once (as many times as the rockin' town of Kenora has won it!)

Tkachuk over to Zhamnov, up to Sel{nne, he shoots, he scores! 
The Jets win the Cup!  The Jets win the Cup!
Essensa for Vezina!  Housley for Norris!  Sel{nne for Calder!

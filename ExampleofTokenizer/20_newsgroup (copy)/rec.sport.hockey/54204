It was a classy move.  But it looks like ESPN is going to devote most of
the coverage to the Pens.  On Tuesday night, they continued to broadcast
the Pen-Devil game even though Pittsburgh had the game well in control.
Granted they did show some "bonus" coverage of the Caps and Isles but
they cut away from the close game, which went into double ot, to update
us on the fifth goal of the rout.
Thursday was a good game even if it was the second straight game between
the pens and devils.  IMHO they should program some variety into the
telecasts.(Yes I know the game shown on saturday is between the B's and
Sabres, probably throwing a bone to us Bruin fans.)
And what about the Cambell conference?  I'd like to see a game in the
Norris or Smythe.  Why not have back to back nights of National
Hockey Night?

Just a thought.

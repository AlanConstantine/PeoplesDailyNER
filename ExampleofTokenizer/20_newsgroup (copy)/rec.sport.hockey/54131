Can the Sabres win two more games against the Bruins?

I think game three in Buffalo will be the most important of the
series.  If the Sabres lose that game, the party will be over.  It will 
be hello next year.

The key for the remaining games in the series will be whether Fuhr can
keep up his brillliant goaltending and if Mogilny can continue skate by 
the Bruins.  He has shown demonstrated excellent speed.

Finally, the Sabres appear to have shown up for the post season.

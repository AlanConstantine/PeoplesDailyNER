Antonio,you weren't alone.

ABC ratings were very good. I was schocked to hear that ABC's telecast
was the fifth most watched sporting event over the weekend. National
rating came out to a very respectable 3.3. Top-29 Nielsen markets were
at 2.9. In Boston,the game scored lower at 2.4 but it had some competion
from local sports teams.
Quite frankly, I expected ABC's ratings to be under 2.0. But I'm happy
to be proven wrong!

Well,well...Sometimes it pays off clicking away on your cable-tv remote
control.:-) And if you happen to be a hockey fan,you could just stumble
upon a playoff hockey game...

ESPN picked up Detroit-Toronto game on Monday night because the only
night game in MLB was being rained out in Chicago. You have to give
ESPN credit for switching to Detroit's FOX-50 coverage and having Bill
Clement at a Pittsburgh's TV station(WATE?) for intermission analysis.
Maybe,ESPN people were giddy over perliminary over-night ABC ratings
for Sunday's telecast and thought it was a good idea to feature the
Norris division showdown rather than a monster truck competion.
Good move,ESPN!

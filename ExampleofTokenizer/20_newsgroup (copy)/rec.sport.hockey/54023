    The tv coverage of the playoffs is fucking ridicules.  Overtime time games
    that are not shown?  What the hell kind of shit is this?  If that would
    have happened to the Flyers(if they were in the damn playoffs to begin
    with) while I was watching, I would have gone throught the roof!

    However, everybody is getting pissed off at ESPN, but they are not the
    ones to blame.  They have prior contracts that they just can't simply break
    whenever they want to.  The N.H.L. is to blame.  When they signed the
    deal with ESPN, they had to know of this.  They had to know shit like this
    would happen since they wouldn't have complete priority.  The N.H.L.
    should be feeling the heat that is being thrown at ESPN.  How can the
    N.H.L. do this to its fans? How dare they.  We are the ones that make the
    damn league exist and they can't even televise complete playoff games for us to
    watch!  They more I write about this, the more pissed off I get.  We must
    let the N.H.L. know that  we expect a little better than this.  If anybody
    out there knows how to go about doing this, let me and everybody else know.

    Well I had to get that off my chest and while I'm at it....

    Mario is the Michael Jordan of hockey.  All that fucker has to do is fall
    on the ice and the closet guy to him gets at least 2.  Last night in the
    3rd game between NJ and Pitt, he was being pushed while skating across the
    front of the goal while trying to get a shot off.  The guy on him was
    doing a good job, so he got off a weak shot, but then he decided to fall
    to the ice. Then the fucking ref(Van Helloamend?) called the guy for
    holding.  They replayed the play, and my roomate(who is clueless about
    hockey) wanted to know what the NJ guy did to get a call, because it was so fucking obvious the NJ player
    had both hands on his stick, and no, he did not trip him.  It is simple,
    Mario gets touched, he falls to the ice, automatic 2.  But the thing that
    really pissed me off is, Pitt scored the 3rd or 4th goal, I don't remember,
    on the resulting PP and
    eventually won 4-3.  His diving/calls makes a HUGE difference in the
    outcome of a game.

    They gotta stop the damn holding and interference that is so fucking
    obvious. That is not hockey.  It allows inferior players to bring down the
level of the better players, and allows inferior teams to beat better ones.
This has pissed me off for many years now, and it has improved somewhat.
However, during the playoffs and 3rd periods, the damn refs must misplace
their balls, because they sure don't make any calls that show that they got
any.

    All agreeing or disagreeing replies are welcomed.

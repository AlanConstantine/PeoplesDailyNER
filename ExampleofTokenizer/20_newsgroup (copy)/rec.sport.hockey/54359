In four of the five games Finns have played, the goalie has been chosen
the best player of the opposing team. (In the fifth, the finnish goalie, 
Ketterer was elected the best Finn) Has this to do with the goalies 
having good days in these games, or are the finnish players just lousy
scorers???

Anyway, quite few goals have been scored in these games in generally
(the exception of course being Canada vs. Italy).  It looks like the
goalies are getting too good.  Is this due to their equipment getting
bigger, so they cover more (their gloves, e.g. seem to be much bigger
now than they were some years ago).

Anybody know if the rules on goalie equipment has changed this way????

J<--> What a game, we finally beat those diques...and in O.T.!
J<--> The Habs dominated this game and especially in O.T..

You realize that we dominated game 1 also and should be ahead in this 
series 2 - 1?

J<--> Glorieux were plagued by bad luck; the puck wouldn't bounce their

And it's about time! We hit 2 posts in this overtime and 1 post in 
game 1's overtime. Let's hope that **we** start getting some luck for 
a change.

He played well in this game but Roy's inconsistency still makes me 
nervous. Otherwise, I'd say we're going to win this series, no sweat. 
It's all up to Patrick Roy to provide **consistent** goaltending.

J<--> And those damn Bruins lost in O.T., their down 3-0.  Congratulations
J<--> Buffalo!!

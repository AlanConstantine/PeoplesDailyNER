Why do you say this?  As of now, the Pens and Bruins have played the
same number of games, and given up the same number of goals.  They are
tied for the third and fourth best defenses in the league, behind
Chicago first and Toronto second.  The Pens' weak spot is defense?  Only
by comparison to their offense, which is second in the league to
Detroit.  But the Pens are no weaker on defense and goaltending than the
Bruins are; that is, they are both very strong.

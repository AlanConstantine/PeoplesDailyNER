Here are the ones I can remember offhand:

     KDKA    1020 AM   Pittsburgh Penguins
     WABC     770 AM   New Jersey Devils
     WBBM     780 AM   Chicago Blackhawks
     WJM (?)  720 AM   Detroit Redwings
     KMOX    1120 AM   St. Louis Blues

Are the Flyers on 1210?
That's all I can think of.

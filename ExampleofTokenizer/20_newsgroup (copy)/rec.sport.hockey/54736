2) Hitting....Hawks tried to outmuscle Blues but could not do it.
Instead, Blues matched Hawks hit for hit and crunched the shit out of
them in game #4.....Scud line, Shanahan, Butcher, and Zombo particularly
took turns bashing favorite targets like Chelios.

3) Skating.....when the Hawks tried to outskate Blues, they could not do
that either.  Nelson Emerson finally showed up and skated circles around
flat footed Chicago defense.....Hedican, Felsner, Ron Wilson and others
also proved that with old cement skaters like Goulet and Keith Brown,
Blues could lap Chicago in a 400 M relay race.


     I agree with #2 but you are wrong about #3.  In fact, the only
     point where the Hawks in any way matched the Blues was when
     they quit trying to outmuscle and instead tried to outskate
     the Blues.  They scored and took the lead.  Too bad it was
     Game 4 and they then took some stupid penalties.  When the
     Hawks skated, they outskated the Blues and took control.

	Well, Druce pretty much sucked when he was with the Caps. He had one
good **playoffs** (not season). oh well. The Caps are notorious for making
stupid trades anyway, as can be seen with the Cicarelli and Hrivnak trades.
Sigh.
	In another note... I'd have to say the Caps biggest surprise was 
Cote, as many Caps fans had been expecting a lot from Bondra already.

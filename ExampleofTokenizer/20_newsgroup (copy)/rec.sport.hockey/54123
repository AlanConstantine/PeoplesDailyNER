All these people who send in their polls should take a closer look at
NJD, they are a very deep team, with two very capable goalies, and
excellent forwards and defensemen.  Shooter in Richer, an all around do
it all in Todd, chef Stasny-master of a thousand dishes, power play
captain-Stevens.  Take a look at the numbers, or play with them and see

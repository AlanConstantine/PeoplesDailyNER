Pure and Simple, Grant Fuhr is money.  He has been awesome in the playoffs,
especially last night.  But Mogilny has been scoring well, and his russian
friend Kymlev (sp?) has also done well.  But Fuhr is the biggest reason they
are winning, and the difference between this year's team and previous years.

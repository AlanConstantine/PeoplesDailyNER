    I remember reading an article in Reader's digest many moons ago
 about a similar incident. During a minor leaque game a player neck was
 cut when the opponent he was back-checking tripped and his skakes
 flew up. In this case the victim's mask proved a hinderance since
 his face was protected and so he didn't bother with the
 usually instinctive reaction to protect his face/neck. A quick        
 thinking coach saved his life by applying direct pressure and using
 snow to contract the blood vessels (from what I can remember).

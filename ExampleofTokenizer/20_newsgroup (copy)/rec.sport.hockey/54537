I'm not bored either.  Most people I know say that winning the second Cup
was better than the first but to me nothing will ever top that first one.
But I'm every bit as excited this year and I am experiencing that inner calm
to which Susan originally referred.  Inner calm is not boredom.

As far as the arena in general being boring, well Richard's got that right.
It's been that way all season.  I attribute it to a lot of new fans who
just don't have the same spirit and knowledge as long-time fans.  At
last Tuesday's game, I overheard a man express surprise that a
goaltender can get an
assist.

Anyone who follows sports with regularity knows that anything can happen
at any time.  I'm confident in the Pens but I'm also not stupid enough to
think for one minute that it's impossible for New Jersey to blow them out
of this series.  I doubt that will happen but it's possible.  Bored?  Uh-uh.
Spoiled?  Not in the least.  Forgot what excitement is like?  Living through
that amazing streak wasn't exciting?!  I don't take a darned thing for
granted.  God, look at Chicago...

And I see no problem with quietly savoring all of this anyway.  It isn't gonna
last forever and I intend to enjoy it while I can.  

Mom.

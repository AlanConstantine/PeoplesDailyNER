That was Clint Malarchuk.  That was a very dangerous accident.  He could he
died right there on the ice.  However, he has played since  
but I don't know where he is now.  I think he is still playing but I'm
not positive.  He was a Sabre at the time.
I don't know who skated into him though.

I remember a couple of seasons before the Malarchuk incident Borje
Salming of Toronto fell down in the crease and someone skated into
his face.  That took a lot of stiches to fix.

I think Murray has done a great job.  He's picked up Ciccarelli,
Sheppard, Ysebaert, Howe, Coffey, and Riendeau (plus some depth players) 
without giving up anything the Wings needed or any of his top prospects.
All of this in three years.  Has anyone done better?

The year before he took over, the Wings didn't even make the playoffs.
There was about a year and a half during Demers' stint that the Wings
did OK, but that was due to Demers' motavational skills and clutch
and grab style.  They didn't have much talent.

Gerald, Murray wasn't responsible for Primeau (although I'm not
ready to admit that's a horrible pick).  They hired him after the
draft (which has never made sense to me).  His first pick was
Lapointe.

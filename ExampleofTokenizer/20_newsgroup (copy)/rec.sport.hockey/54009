Bowman is in the Hockey Hall of Fame as a coach already...and unlike
Gil Stein...he didn't get their by stacking the Board of Directors! -)

Bowman is the genius...Johnson isn't.  Bowman is a great coach...Johnson,
a very good one.  However, Bowman is really not a modern coach, and
Patrick's solution of having him only run the team on game days, and
delegate most of the day-to-day responsibity to the assistants is
a shrewd managerial decision on Patrick's part.

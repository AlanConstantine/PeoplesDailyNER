It looks like the Edmonton Oilers just decided to take a European
vacation this spring...

Ranford, Tugnutt, Benning, Manson, Smith, Buchberger, and Corson
are playing for Canada.

Podein and Weight are playing for the US.

Is Kravchuk playing for the Russians...I know he had nagging
injuries late in the season.

Podein is an interesting case...because he was eligible to
play in Cape Breton in the AHL playoffs like Kovalev, Zubov,
and Andersson...obviously Sather and Pocklington are not
the total scrooges everyone makes them out to be...certainly
in this case they've massively outclassed Paramount and the
New York Rangers.

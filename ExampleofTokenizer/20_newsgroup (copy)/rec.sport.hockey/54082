The only way to change ESPN's thinking, if it is even possible, is to complain
to them directly.  Anyone know there telephone # in Bristol, Ct?  

I do find it hard to believe that ESPN doesn't think viewers will simply
change the channel from a boring game....I know I did.  And then, when
they didn't show the NYI-Wash overtime(s), I was livid!  If I wanted
to watch baseball, I could have turned on the Phillies-Padres extra
inning game....instead, I went to bed angry......I boycotted ESPN's
morning Sportscenter today, I was still so incensed.

My wife says I shouldn't go to bed angry, but last nite.........GRRRRRRR!

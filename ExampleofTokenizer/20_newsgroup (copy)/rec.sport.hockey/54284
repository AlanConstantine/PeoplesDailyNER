Exactly my point.  If you'd watch games more closely, you'd see a lot 
of goons going after him.  Ulf is one of the main reasons why less physical 
players for Pgh are left alone.  Ulf plays rough hockey, but only when 
other players are putting the rush on Mario or Jagr.  If you want to say anyone
on the Penguins is a cheap shot or a goon, say it's Jennings or Caufield.  Don'tslander a good defenseman because your favorite players can't beat the Pens
even when they take dives (like Gartner) to try for the cheap penalties.

Hey, that's fine!  If a player does something stupid, he should be penalized
including Ulf.  Or Mario (you're not likely to see that happen) or anyone else for that matter.  It's pointless to say any one person is a cheap-shot goon,     because you'll see EVERYONE take a cheap shot now and then, especially if you'resomeone who is shadowed as much as Ulf is.

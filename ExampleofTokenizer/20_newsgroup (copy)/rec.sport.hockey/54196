Speaking of Roger, where is his comments from last nights game. You have
to admit he can make a nothing game sound like it was game 7 of the
Stanley Cup finals.
Roger pushes the Leafs so much it even bothers me, a long time supporter
but he does have a good overall idea of the game.
Wow I just gave R.M a compliment, guess I better stop it with the Rye +
Water before I give him another..

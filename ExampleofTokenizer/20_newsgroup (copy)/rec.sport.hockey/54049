The problem is that (by no fault of ESPN) ongoing games are not
covered 'til the final horn sounds.  With two channels, SCNY and SCA,
late-finishing games (up to Pacific time) and overtimes elsewhere will
kick in at the end of local coverage.  If SCNY is blocked by the Mets,
there is still some hockey on SCA (SCNY Plus).

With an ESPN 2, the current situation would be alleviated.

Actually it was in the third period, his return did bring a spark to the
crowd, and to the players, who played awesome defense in the third.

You forgot about Gretzky.  If any of these guys start scoring, the Kings
will be unstoppable, if they continue the great defensive work as well.

Stauber will be in net on Tuesday.  Hopefully he will provide another
stellar performance and earn the name Robb "Stopper" Stauber.

I believe this is how they are...I know it is Gretzky and Sandstrom, but he
has been putting a number of people on left.  Also the Carson, Robataille
Kurri line once ignited, will light the fire of the other lines.
(Hopefully!)

It is evident that the scoring drought is getting to Luc, after his slight
breakaway in the third (I think) he was steamed on the bench, this emotion
might help him break his streak.  Also, I have noticed Blake has had a few
really good chances to score, but has fanned, or shot wide.  Is the injury
still affecting him?

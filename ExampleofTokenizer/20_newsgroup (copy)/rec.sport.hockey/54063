We must have been watching two different games.   The Devil had one hand on
Mario's elbow and pulling the elbow caused Mario to fall so the call was
appropriate.

Using clueless people to substantiate your claims doesn't give me a lot of
confidence in your call either.  Next time consider getting a second opinion
from a clueful observer.  Or maybe all those available disagreed.

Nonsense.  I quite clearly state that it was Greg that made the claim
that Gainey never made an error.  And he made the claim. Read below.

[nonsense deleted]

Gainey is the best defensive forward ever.  I stand by that assessment.
He was a very good player who belongs in the hall of fame.  Did you
ever watch him play? He never made a technical error.

To knowledgeable observers of the game my meaning is obvious.  Your
hockey education is not my responsibility.

He was just another player.  To laud him as anything more I find
bothersome.  I hated the Habs.  I hated Lafleur until I realized
that he was likely the most aesthetically pleasing player to ever 
skate in my lifetime.  Why would anyone talk about Gainey?

Did he play hockey at a high level?  Was he any good?  If not, why
would you bother to bring JC up?  I am talking about hockey players
here.  If you can't follow the conversation don't follow up.  As I
said previously, it is not my responsibility to educate you.

Sure.  Two journeymen.  Big deal.  Neither one of them is worth
discussing.

That is an excellent idea and if I decide to waste any more time
responding to any of your, or Greg's, postings then I will be sure
to implement that very macro.

Tarasov claimed that Gainey was a "hockey god."  And Greg ate it up.
And that is what this thread is all about.  If you didn't know 
that then why are you responding?

And as for "blanket disregard for these individuals", I can remember 
Leaf teams, purely populated by such "individuals", winning four 
Stanley Cups.  Teams.  No one ran around telling us that George
Armstrong was the best hockey player in the world.

Right.  I had to get to the end of your posting before I realized you were 
a complete joke.

In the future, if you are going to respond to my postings I would appreciate
it if you could present a cogent argument supported by facts gleaned from a
version of reality that most of the rest of us would recognize.

cordially, as always,

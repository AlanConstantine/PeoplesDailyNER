Them thar's fighting words...hardly a force...geez...miss the playoffs
once in 15 years, and even after making the final four 3 times in the
last five years, and everyone thinks its doomsville.

Fedorov, Primeau, Kozlov, Lidstrom, Sillinger, Konstantinov, Drake,
Kennedy, Racine, and Cheveldae were already in the pipeline due to
Devellano...Murray inherited these guys...in addition to Yzerman,
Probert, Carson, Chiasson, etc.

No...Quinn had far less...Murray took over Detroit at a time to 
take advantage of all of Devellano's good drafting...if Devellano
had not given in to Demers request to make the Oates trade, he might
still be GM.

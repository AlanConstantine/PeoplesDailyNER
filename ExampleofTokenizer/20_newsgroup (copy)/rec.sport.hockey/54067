Unfortunately, that is the way the league is heading... You can't fight,
so the only way to retaliate against someone is with a cheap shot when
the ref isn't looking. Ulf has brought this to a high level... Players
stuck in the past (like Neely) who prefer fights to cheap shots
are at a disadvantage in the new system.

Lets face it, A cheap shot (like high sticking) is a very effective
method... It is easier to hide from the refs, has a better chance of
causing injury, and you can draw people into fights that way. I don't
like it, but that's the way the league is going.

By the way, there was a rather good hit by Ulf in the last Penguin-Devil
game. Managed to hit the NJ player in the face with a stick. (Must have been a
legal hit... After all, Ulf is a clean player and is allowed to do
things like that.)

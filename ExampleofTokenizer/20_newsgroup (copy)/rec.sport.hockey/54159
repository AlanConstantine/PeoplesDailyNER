Grrrr, let's start a whole 'nother topic on show bad the sharks are doing on
these things. I swear that ALL of my partial plan games were televised (I
know, I'm exaggerating, but...).
In order:
-the new ticket prices suck
-wait 'till people try to park at games next year. Public transit? Yeah
right, I'd love to take caltrain for 3 hours to see a 3 hour game.

Shelling out hundreds of dollars for partial season plans for two years
doesnt mean anything to the sharks, as I get to pick my seats after the dead
rise from their graves to claim their seats! :-)

RA>    Here's the point: there are far too many Europeans in the NHL.

I disagree.  I think the NHL should feature the best hockey talent in
the world -- regardless of nationality.  I have to admit that when I 
see players like Gretzky and Messier traded off to the US because the
Canadian teams can't afford them, I have been know to say (only half-
seriously) that we'd probably be better off if we had our own Canadian
hockey league for Canadian players! ;-)

RA> I'm all for the creation of a European Hockey League, and let

RA> I just don't want themon mine.   
 
Again, it doesn't matter to me -- Russian, Finnish, Mexican, Albertan,
New Yorker, black, white, korean, martian, plutoneon, ... it doesn't
matter.
 
Any of them can put a Leafs' jersey on if they can put the puck in!

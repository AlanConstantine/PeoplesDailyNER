Mr. Bettman	The Guy in the Wrong Sport
Mr. Stein	The Guy Who Should Be In Charge But Isn't

Of course, we also need new names for the individual awards, and other
stuff like the President's Cup.

President's Cup		The Trophy Given To the Best Regular-Season Team
Hart winner		The Most Valuable Player, chosen from the
				Guys in the Middle, the Guys on the
				Right, the Guys on the Left, the Guys
				Back There, and the Guy in the Net,
				though typically given only to the
				Guys in the Middle and the Guys on 
				the Left and on the Right
Norris winner		The Best Guy in the back; or, the Guy who was
				awarded for something even though he
				is not one of the Guys in the Middle
				or on the Left or the Right

...ad nauseum.

The rumour was basically everywhere in Toronto based on reports
that Keenan has told both San Jose and Philadelphia that he
was no longer interested in pursuing further negotiations with
either team. 

The Ranger announcement is supposed to happen tomorrow supposedly.

The Rangers have so many veterans that they had to get a coach
with "weight" and a proven record...and whom they know Messier respects.

Well that's really great Pat.  I guess since you've played a little you thereby 
qualify as an expert.  Especially since you watch all the games on t.v.  All 
that qualifies you as is a armchair quarterback or a coach potato

Again just further evidence as to what kind of an expert you are.  Truly a 
stupid statement.  Mario is definately one of the best players to play the game.
I'm not saying he is the best to ever play the game, but he should come to
mind when that question is asked.  Let's face it, he just returns from 
radiation therapy with around a dozen games left, overtakes Lafontaine for the
scoring lead and then buries him!!!!  No, I guess he just got lucky.
Speaking of Lafontaine, now there's a guy who should be considered for the
Hart trophy as well, certainly one of the better players in the league this
year.

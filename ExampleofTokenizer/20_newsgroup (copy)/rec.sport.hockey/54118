        Well as for team captains being traded
        in there first year in the NHL the
        Edmonton Oilers traded their captain
        Ron Chiperfield to the Quebec Nordique
        right at the trading deadline for 
        Goaltender Ron Lowe
        In their second year of existence
        The Edmonton Oilers again right at the trade 
        deadline traded their captain, this time 
        B.J. McDonald to the Vancouver Canucks
        along with the rights to winger Ken 
        Berry for Garry Lariviere and the rights 
        to Lars Gunner Petterson 
        
        as for more captain trivia, the next Edmonton
        captain was Lee Fogilin who was later traded to
        the Buffalo Sabres, after him was Wayne Gretzky
        who was traded to L A, then came Kevin Low who
        only this year was traded to the N Y Rangers
        so that every captain the Edmonton Oilers have had
        has been traded.

        The present captain is Craig McTavish and we'll
        just have to wait and see.


        well talk to you later

        Steve

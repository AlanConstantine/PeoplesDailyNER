Just a side note, squid/octopi made their way to the ice in Buffalo.
I still don't understand why Buffalo, but maybe it's lucky.  :-)  btw,
they shovel them up from the ice here, using the shovel used to scoop
up the snow the zamboni leaves as it leaves the ice.  Although Blue
did give some technical directions on its removal, motioning with his
stick.

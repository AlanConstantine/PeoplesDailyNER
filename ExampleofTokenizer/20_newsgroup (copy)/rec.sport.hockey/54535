You, along with Mario Lemieux, must be from another planet.  The only
difference is that Lemieux comes from the one with Geo. Washington, Abe
Lincoln (and many other great men and women of this world) whereas you come
from the one with David Koresh.  Yeah, Mario is good at drawing penalties,
but wouldn't you try do something (you do claim to play) to give your team
an advantage?  I don't remember Lemieux getting any diving penalties this
year, whereas many others did.  Finally, Mario has NEVER complained about
being hit.  He knows it's part of the game; he gets back by dishing out an
even bigger hit to the same guy or just scoring a few goals (or setting
them up.)  Don't you have any compassion for a man who has gone through so
much in his life?

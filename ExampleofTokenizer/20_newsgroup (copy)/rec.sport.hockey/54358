Disaster! Finland was beaten by Czech 1-3 (0-0,1-1,0-2).
Finland will be 4th of pool B and will most certainly meet Canada in the
quarter final on wednesday 28th. Lack of scoring skills has
been the major problem of team Finland throughout the tournament.
Briza (goalie)  was the MVP of  the Czech team and Tikkanen was the 
MVP of the Finnish team.

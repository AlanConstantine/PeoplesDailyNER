 Well, here in Detroit we get to see and hear Don Cherry quite regularly.
The Detroit area picks up Hockey Night in Canada from CBC (ch 9) in
Windsor where we see Don Cherry's Coaches Corner between periods. We
also get to see Don Cherry's Grapevine just before the game. The
Grapevine is a hockey talk show where Don talks to a player or coach
about what else: Hockey.  It's actually a pretty good show and Don
isn't as annoying as he is on Coaches Corner.  I think this is were
Don got his nickname 'Grapes' but I'm not sure.  Don use to coach the
Boston Bruins.  I don't know exactly when that was.  Could someone fill
me in on this info?
  A local radio station here in Detroit (WLLZ) talks to Don every Tuesday
morning.  Personally, I've had my fill of Donny!  He really pisses me off
sometimes.  During the Detroit-Toronto game Monday night on CBC, Don gave
high praise to Doug Gilmour, saying he was a two-way player and not
just a designated goal scorer and that he is probably the best player
in the game because of that.  That's fine and I agree that Gilmour
is a good two-way player BUT he said the EXACT same thing about Yzerman
about a month ago on a local radio talk show.  What gives?
  It seems like he just has a set speech that he changes when he goes from
city to city.
  Don Cherry:  'I think <insert star player name for city that he is in>
              is the best two-way player in the league today.'
 
  There have been other times (can't remember exactly what he said) that he
basically changed his opinions to match the audience he was talking to.
  Someone here on the net said something about how Don criticized Mario
Lemieux but when the time comes for Don to broadcast the Cup playoffs
from the Civic Center (Yes, I think the Pens will make it out of the
Wales Conference) Don will apologize left and right for his remarks about
Lemieux.  In my opinion, he is an ass.  And I won't change my opinion
if I'm in a different city.
  Sorry, if this didn't answer your question better but I just had to get
this off my chest.

Yep, though my reasons for being relatively quiet are simple...last year
I woofed when we went up 3-1 on the Canucks...and look where it got me.  :)

Domi got tossed in the 2nd with a high-sticking major.  He had been
playing with Kris King and Stu Barnes...and it was this line that was
arguably the best in the first two games.

Definitely a good thing...every little cheer helps, Evan.  :)
Good thing the net doesn't need a voice to operate...I won't have one
Sunday night when I get home, I hope.  White noise here we come!  ;)

One thing, I WILL say though...Vancouver can KEEP Steve Armitage and
John Garrett as a broadcast team...those two are BAD, especially when
you are spoiled by Don Wittman.  (At least four or five times, Steve called
Barnes Selanne.  Whoops! :)

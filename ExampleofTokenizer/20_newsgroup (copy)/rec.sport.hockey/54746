As far as Cheveldae is concerned, he is a decent goalie.  The most logical
trade in the offseason to me would be between Detroit and NY Rangers.  I'm sure
if Beezer would be traded he would enjoy the opportunity to go back to his
roots in Detroit.  He would be a valuable asset to the Wings and Perhaps the
Rangers could get a Zombo in return?  Beezer got a few good years in him and
the opportunity to get a fresh start would energize his play.

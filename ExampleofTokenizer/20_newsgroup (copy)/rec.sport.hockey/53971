It is a long standing good luck Redwing's tradition to throw an octopus 
on the ice during a Stanley Cup game. They say it dates back to '52
at the Olympia when the Wings became the 1st team (I think) to sweep 
the cup in 8 games. A lot hardet to throw one from Joe Louis seats
than from the old Olympia balcony, though.

Funniest I ever saw was when some Tiger fans threw one on the field
during a Detroit/Toronto baseball game ...  I was living in California
and the folks I was watching with had never heard of hockey and were 
incredulous when I recognized the octopus BEFORE the camera closeup !!

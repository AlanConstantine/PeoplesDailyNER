  Gerald, look at what happened to the Stars; they are off to Dallas.

Gerald, the Alberta election is slated fou 7 June, unless something RE?ALLY goes 
wrong this time!!  Pocklington could end up being THE embarassment of Klein
if he goes ahead with his 'ultimatum'.

Gerald,  people still have an axe to grind with this guy.  I CANNOT see him staying for long.

But the people in Edmonton won't budge, trust me on this one.

Northlands won't budge ccording to one of the board members, Bruce Campbell.

I haven't heard anything, BUT attendance at the Coliseum was the lowest this 
year.  HINT!!HINT!!  Remeber what I said about a personal vendetta?

Gerald, don't blame Sather.  This battle between the peole and Pocklington
started in 1986 and got WORST when Pocklington sold Gretzky.  

There were days when you can shake the hand of Pocklington when he was
respectalbe( I use to do so in 1982 - 1983 season) , but those days are GOE!!

What sadist brought up this vein about Malarchuk?  When I saw what
happened I wanted to throw up, and at the same time I was devastated,
since I thought that Malarchuk wouldn't survive.  BTW, I believe he picked
up an alcohol problem after (before?) the incident.

To radically change the subject, the Caps must be having nightmares about
the Isles in overtime in the playoffs.  Have they *ever* beaten the
Islanders in a playoff OT game?  This is lunacy.  The Caps are such a
sorry team in the playoffs, they consistently choke against opponents who
they should be beating.  Losing two OT games in a row is not coincidence,
it's evidence of the choke factor.

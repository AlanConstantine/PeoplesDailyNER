You think that's bad?  I'm in Bowling Green, OH, and we get ABC from
Toledo.  Well, the cable co. decided to totally pre-empt the game (no tape
delay, no nothing) for a stupid telethon!  Hockey is very big around here,
too.  I had to listen to "my" Penguins win on my car radio out in the
parking lot.  I can just be thankful for a strong radio because being 230
miles from Pittsburgh, the reception usually isn't good at all.  I can't
believe I picked it up during the middle of the day.

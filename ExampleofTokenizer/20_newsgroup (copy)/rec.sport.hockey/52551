Implicitly you are assuming that goals scored against Winnipeg with Selanne
on the ice can be blamed on him...Roger, he is a FORWARD.  Winnipeg has a
lousy defensive record anyway.  Let's put it another way.  John Cullen's +/-
is terrible.  What's your excuse for him?  That his powerplay points don't
count?  Neither do Selanne's...

feeding Selanne so he can score does contribute in a meaningful way to
winning.

Nope, didn't see it.  I was too busy watching Foligno jump up and down after
_his_ goal....

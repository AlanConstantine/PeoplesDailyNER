Hey American Hockey fans,

As a hockey fan I can sympathize with thefrustration that you feel.  The
problem is that other Americans don't give a shit about hockey.  They view
it as a bunch of Canadians with bad accents and missing teeth beating the
shit out of each other on a patch of ice when it is too warm now in
two-thirds of the US to see the stuff naturally.  On the other hand
BASEBALL is the *gasp**swoon**sigh* "NATIONAL PASTTIME".  BASEBALL is so
romanticized in the US that you are supposed to forget that other sport
exist after April 1 and before November 1.  I feel that since ESPN shows 5+
BASEBALL games a week they should be able to show an OT hockey game instead
of the opening innings of a BASEBALL game.  Hell, the game is going to last
2hrs 45mins, so what if you miss the first 1 1/2 hrs?  And I am an Indians
fan!  Show the end of what you started, then switch!  But then, I'm a
hockey fan, what do I know?  BASEBALL is the all mighty sport.

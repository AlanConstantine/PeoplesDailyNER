I have often thought about, if its possible to have a powerfull laser
on earth, to light at the Moon, and show lasergraphics at the surface
so clearly that you can see it with your eyes when there is a new
moon.

How about a Coca Cola logo at the moon, easy way to target billions of
people.

Do you know if its possible?

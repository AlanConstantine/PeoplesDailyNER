If this man Clark is a NASA administrator then god save NASA. Of course
the Shuttles record is unrivaled !  There is only one Shuttle. Furthermore,
there is only likely to be one Shuttle now that Hermes and Boron are 
effectively cancelled.

These officials should spend more of their time explaining to their
European and Asian partners how we are expected to believe in them
when their paymasters change their minds on major international
projects everytime a new US administration takes office (considering
the major impacts this has on the European and Asian (Japanese)
industry). It is also appreciated how this affects American
industry. I am of course talking about Space Stattion Freedom.

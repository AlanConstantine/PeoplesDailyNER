I am taking a course entitled "Exploring Science Using Internet".
For our final project, we are to find a compendium of Internet resources 
dealing with a science-related topic. I chose Astronomy. Anyway, I was 
wondering if anyone out there knew of any interesting resources on Internet
that provide information on Astronomy, space, NASA, or anything like that.

THANKS!

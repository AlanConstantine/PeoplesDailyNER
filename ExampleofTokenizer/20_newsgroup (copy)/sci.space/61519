I commend everybody to look at the FTP site 'ftp.cicb.fr'
-> Ethernet address 129.20.128.2 <-
in the directory /pub/Images/ASTRO:
there are lots of images (all of kinds in astronomy subject)
especially in GIF format and a NEW ! directory of some JPL animations

For your comfort, README files in all subdirectories give size and
description of each image, and a 7 days' newer images' list is in READMENEW

Note: you can connect it as 'anonymous' or 'ftp' user, then the quota
      for each is 8 users connected in the same time.
      So, if the server responds you "connection refused", be patient !

2nd note: this site is reachable by Gopher at 'roland.cicb.fr'
          -> Ethernet address 129.20.128.27 <-
          in 'Divers serveurs Ftp/Le serveur ftp du CRI-CICB/Images/ASTRO'

If you have any comments, suggestions, problems,
then you can contact me at E-mail 'rousself@univ-rennes1.fr'

Hope you enjoy it !

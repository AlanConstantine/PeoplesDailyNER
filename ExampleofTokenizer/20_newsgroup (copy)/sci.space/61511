Hi Folks,

              Last year America bought two  "Hall Generators" which are
used as thrusters for space vehicles from former USSR,if I could recall
correctly these devices were sent to JPL,Pasadena labs for testing and
evaluation.
     
              I am just curious to know  how these devices work and what
what principle is involved .what became of them.There was also some
controversy that the Russian actually cheated,sold inferior devices and
not the one they use in there space vehicles.

Any info will be appreciated...
  ok   {                         Thank{ in advance...

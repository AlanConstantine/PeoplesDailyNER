Question: what is the power spectrum of the bursts. Are their sharp lines?
If so, can they be interpreted as blue-shifted atomic or molecular lines?

Can electron-positron annihilation gammas be seen in the bursts? Are they
red shifted or blue shifted?

Since the bursts are isotropic and maybe in the galactic halo they may
be saying something about dark matter in the halo.

If the bursts are something like the cosmic black body radiation from
way back then where are the red shifts - I mean cosmological red shifts?

Consider a wild idea - what if the bursts are advanced photons from the
future rather than retarded ones from the past. Would advanced photons
from far future when universe was considerably more expanded get
blue shifted as they propagate to younger states of the universe?

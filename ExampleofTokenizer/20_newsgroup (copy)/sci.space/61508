It is kind of absurd, isn't it?  Some players even want more distortion,
especially the Hendrix fans :-)  But there are a lot of them out there
that can only afford the amp, or who like playing music without distortion.
Then there are your hard-core Hendirx fans that want particular *types*
of distortion, i.e., they make it, not their amps.

I didn't see a thing about waste-heat from Babbage, and haven't seen one
of those mechanical TV's in a while, so it's anybodie's guess :-)

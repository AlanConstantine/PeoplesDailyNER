"The Forever War", one of my favorite SciFi books, had a passage devoted to 
breathing fluids. The idea was to protect people from the high accelerations 
required for interstellar travel by emersing the passengers in dry-cleaning 
fluid saturated with oxygen. Plenty of very imaginative ideas is this book.
I would certainly recommend it (won the Hugo and the Nebula awards).

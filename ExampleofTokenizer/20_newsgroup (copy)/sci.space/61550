Why can't an aircraft be designed so that the pilot can always be 
maintained in a upright position, perpendicular to the plane of
acceleration?  With the visual helmets now being used that display
some of the flight parameters and with a keyboard and manuvering
equipment moving with the pilot, a pilot may be able to function at
accelerations in excess of 12G.  Is anyone currently pursuing this
area or is there a reason why this is impossible at the present time?

     You'll find that in Allen, C.W., "Astrophysical Quantities", Athlone
Press, Dover, NH, 3rd edition, pp. 268-269 (1973).  To the accuracy it can
be calculated (see specific references in Allen about how it is
calculated), the temperature is 3 degrees K.

     Lots of people have remarked on this temperature.  The first may have
been in Eddington's book, "Internal Constitution of Stars", Ch. 13 (1926;
reprinted 1986), where he gives the "temperature of space" as 3 degrees.

     The source of this temperature is the radiation of starlight.

     To the accuracy of measurement, it's the same temperature.  Some of us
think this may not be a coincidence.  -|Tom|-

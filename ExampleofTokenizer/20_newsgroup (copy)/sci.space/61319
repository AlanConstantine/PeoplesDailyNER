These seem hardly like the groups to discuss this in, but HUH??? 
All legitimate power to enforce these rights derives from the consent 
of the governed, not from no steenkin' piece of paper.  Civilized gov'mnt 
is not an autonomous computer program, it's interactive.  The Constitution 
was made by the people and can be trashed by us - it ain't no sacred 
scripture from which rights flow.  Our 'rights' come from our souls. 
And I sure didn't see any request to vote on trashing the sky.  
Again - my opinion only - we keep our rights by using them, not going to 
some court.

Well, I seem to have struck an  interesting discussion off.  Given that I
am not an astrophysicist  or nuclear physicist,  i'll have to boil it
down a bit.

1)  ALl the data on bursts to date,  shows a smooth random distribution.

2)  that means they aren't concentrated in  galactic cores, our or someone
elses.

3) If the distribution is smooth,  we are either seeing some  ENORMOUSLY
large phenomena  scattered at the edge of the universe  said phenomena
being subject to debate almost as vioent as the phenomena
	OR
we are seeing some phenomena  out at like the Oort cloud,  but then it needs
some potent little energy source,  that isn't detectable  by any other
current methods.

4)  we know it's not real close,  like  slightly extra solar,  because
we have no parallax measurements on the bursts.

5)  the bursts seem to bright to be something like black hole quanta or
super string  impacts or something like that.

So everyone is watching the data and arguing like mad in the meanwhile.

what i am wondering,  is this in people's opinion,  A NEW Physics problem.

Einstein got well known for solvingthe photoelectric effect.   

Copernicus,  started looking at  irregularities in planetary motion.

Is this a big enough problem, to create a new area of physics?
just a little speculative thinking folks.

Actually, paving ground glass over Lichtenstein wouldn't demonstrate the
strength of Western Capitalism, since it's strength depends on use of
the mind and materials in the fulfillment of needs and desires.  Mind you,
I'm not saying *no-one* would benefit from glassed-over land, but I don't
think anyone would actually pay for it, unlike the (potential) billsats.

I don't quite follow you on the part about someone exposing their genitals
at parties, but I got a chuckle from it anyway.  And I thought I had some
strange friends :-)

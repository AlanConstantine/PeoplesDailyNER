Someone named Hansk asked about pictures.

Well, there is an archive of portraits in xfaces format at
ftp.uu.net. Henry Spencer's picture is there somewhere, along
with several thousand others.

I don't remember the path, though it should be easy to find.
Remember, though, it seems to use both internet and uucp
addresses.

    Hello, All!

  I apologize, I haven't published my astro FTP list since March.
  Now I haven't tested all the sites included into the list.  I
  would notified all the people, you have stored some older issues
  of my, there are now lots of changes.  Many sites have gone away:
  They either do not exist any more or all the astro stuff have
  removed.
 
  The job keep this list is very hard, so all the notes and informat-
  ion of changes, new sites, new contents etc. is welcome.

  I would thank all the net people who give me information for the
  newest version.



  					regards,

Okay, the earth has a magnetic field (unless someone missed something?)

Okay if you put a object in the earth magnetic field, it produces electricty..

Now the question. Can you use electricity to power a space/low earth orbit
vehicle? and i fyou can, can you use the magnetic field of the earth to power
it??
Can the idea of a "dragless" satellite be used in part to create the electrical
field?

After all the dragless satellite is (I might be wrong), a suspended between to
pilons, the the pilons compensate for drag.. I think I know what I want to say,
just not sure how to say it..

A dragless satellite sounds interestingly enough liek a generator.

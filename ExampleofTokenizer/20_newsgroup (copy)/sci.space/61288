. . . David gives good explaination of the deductions from the isotropic,
'edged' distribution, to whit, they are either part of the Universe or
part of the Oort cloud.

Why couldn't they be Earth centred, with the edge occuring at the edge
of the gravisphere? I know there isn't any mechanism for them, but there
isn't a mechanism for the others either.

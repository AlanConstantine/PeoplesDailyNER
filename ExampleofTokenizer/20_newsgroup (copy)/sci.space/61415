	I don't know where you got this idea from, JPL's history dates back to 
	to the 1930s when a Caltech professor named Von Karman conducted  
	experiments in rocket PROPULSION with a group of graduate students
	on the present site of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.   The Army started
	funding the laboratory and had jurisdiction untill the late 1950s when
	NASA took over. The early research conducted at the Laboratory
	led to many applications the first being Jet-assisted takeoff rockets
	for aircraft.  I think this should explain where JPL got it's name, I
	should know, I worked there for five wonderful years.

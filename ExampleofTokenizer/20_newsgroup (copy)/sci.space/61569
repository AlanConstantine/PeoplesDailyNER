All consipiracy theories aside, (they are watching though :-)), will NASA 
try to image the Cydonia region of Mars where the "Face
" is? If they can image it with the High resolution camera, it would 
settle the FACE question once and for all. I mean, with a camera that 
will have a pixel resolution of about 6 feet, we'd know whether all this 
stuff is real or imagination. 

Come on JPL and NASA folks, try to image it and settle this thing.

A harmonic of the Earth's gravitational field?  What IS a harmonic of the
Earth's gravitational field?

14:1 resonance with WHAT?  It's not like there's any wavelength or frequency
to the Earth's gravitational field.  Now, there' might be some interesting
interactions with the Moon's tidal effect--is that what you're talking about?

What are the physics of the situation?  The only way I can see gravitational
effects being useful in adding energy to an object orbiting Earth is some
sort of interaction with the moon.

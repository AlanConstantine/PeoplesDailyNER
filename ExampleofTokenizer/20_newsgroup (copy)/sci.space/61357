   We don't disagree on this.  All I said was that a right is whatever
you or somebody acting for you can enforce.  The Bill of Rights didn't
come into effect until it was ratified by the states (and indirectly,
the people); from that point it defined legal rights.  "Common law"
rights are vague and situational; that's why the people insisted on a
Bill of Rights in the Constitution, spelling out exactly what they
demanded from the government.  Legitimate or illegitimate, power is
power.  That's why the federal government can force states to grant
their citizens rights they don't wish to: In a slugging match, the feds
win.  Period.

   And you're right, this doesn't belong in sci.space.  I've said my
peace.  No more frome me on rights (at least not here).

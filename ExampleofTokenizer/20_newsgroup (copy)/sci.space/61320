Fine. I'll buy from George. GEORGEEE!!!!

That assumes I can't weasel out a cooperative venture of some sort (cut me a
break on the launcher, I'll cut you in on the proceeds if it works).  Only the
government pays higher-than-list price.

Unless you're Martin Marietta, since (as I recall) they bought out the GD line
of aerospace products. 

If MM/GD does it as an in-house project, their costs would look much better
than buying at "list price."  Does anyone REALLY know the profit margins built
in to the Titan?  C'mon. Allen is telling us how cheap we can get improved this
or that...

Oh please.  How much of a profit do you want?  Pulling $100-150 million after
all is said and done wouldn't be too shabby.  Not to mention the other goodies
I'll collect in:

	a)  Movie & TV rights (say $100-150 million conservatively)
	b)  Advertising       ("Look Mommie, they're drinking Coke!")
	c)  Intangibles	      (Name recognization, experience & data 
				acculumated)

If you want lean, fine.  A $500 million prize would be more than adequate for a
prize.

Maybe Wales would be kind enough to define what a company would consider
a decent profit.

If you want R&D done, you'll have to write in R&D clauses.  I suppose you could
make it a SBIR set-aside :)  



    Software engineering? That's like military intelligence, isn't it?

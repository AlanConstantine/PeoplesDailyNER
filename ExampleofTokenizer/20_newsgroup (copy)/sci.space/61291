 Don't remember the spectra, but have seen some autocorrelation functions
 recently.  The ACFs show correlation times of milliseconds to 10s of 
 seconds; interestingly, the higher energies show a shorter correlation 
 time.

 I believe there were claims from an earlier satellite (Ginga?) of 
 detection of cyclotron absorption lines.  These lines were taken as 
 strong evidence for neutron stars being the objects responsible for 
 GRBs since the magnetic field indicated was 1.0E12, fairly typical 
 for a neutron star.  However, Compton GRO has not seen any of these 
 lines and I get the impression that many are beginning to doubt whether
 these lines were ever real.

 *If* the bursts are in the halo, they most certainly are saying something 
 about dark matter there.  However, if they are in the halo, in order 
 that they appear isotropic, the "core radius" of the halo (i.e. the 
 innermost region of the halo) has to be greater than about 50 kpc.
 The halo itself would stretch much further than this.  Since the 
 Andromeda Galaxy is only 700 kpc away, we should be seeing bursts
 from that galaxy's halo, which we aren't.

js> If the bursts are something like the cosmic black body radiation from

 Remember to get a redshift, one needs some type of emission or 
 absorption line so one can compare the observed line frequency 
 to the rest line frequency.  Since no lines are seen in GRB spectra, 
 that comparison cannot be made.

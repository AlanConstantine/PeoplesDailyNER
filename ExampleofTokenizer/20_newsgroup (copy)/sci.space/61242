The compressed image format used for the Voyager disks is not (yet)
supported by any Macintosh display software that I know of. However,
there does exist a program that can convert the images to a format that
is recognized by recent versions of both Pixel Pusher and NIH/Image. It
is called "PDS Decompress" and is available via anonymous ftp from the
"pub" directory on "delcano.mit.edu" [18.75.0.80]. This is a Binhex/
Stuffit archive and contains the application itself, Think-C source,
and a very brief description.

The most recent version of NIH/Image (1.48) may be down-loaded from
"starhawk.jpl.nasa.gov", where it is located in "image148.hqx" in the
"pub" directory. This archive also contains source code, but not the
documentation, which is located in the "image1455.hqx" archive in the
same directory.

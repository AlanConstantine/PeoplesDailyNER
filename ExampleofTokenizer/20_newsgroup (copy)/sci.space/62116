The JPL/San Gabriel AIAA session last week showed the Russian
lander encased in a single large airbag with ravelable stitches.
The Russian design is pretty firm and hardware is due from
international experimenters by 1/94.
The proposed 1997 American lander has a bunch of airbags shaped
like a bunch of grapes.  They were dropping it in the desert last
month.  It may have a 20 kg mini-rover in it.

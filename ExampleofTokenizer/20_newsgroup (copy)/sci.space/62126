I'm replying to someone who asked for information on space camp.
I have a brochure that has all different schedules. What age, what 
level and what program do you want to know the schedule of? Most of the 
missions are 5 to 8 days long. The address for Huntsville is:

Alabama Space Science
Exhibit Commission
U.S. Space and Rocket Center
One Tranquility Base, Huntsville, AL 35807

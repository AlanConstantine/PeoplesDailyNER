   I'm on a fact-finding mission, trying to find out if there exists a list of
   potentially world-bearing stars within 100 light years of the Sun...
   Is anyone currently working on this sort of thing?  Thanks...

In principle, any star resembling the Sun (mass, luminosity) might have planets
located in a suitable orbit. There several within 100 ly of the sun. They are
single stars, for double or multiple systems might be troublesome. There's a
list located at ames.arc.nasa.gov somewhere in pub/SPACE. I think it is called
stars.dat. By the way, what kind of project, if I may know?

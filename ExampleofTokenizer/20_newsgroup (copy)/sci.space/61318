Wouldn't bother me.  I'd laugh.  It wouldn't work -- the surface of the
Moon is *already* pretty dark, and the contrast would be so poor you
couldn't possibly see it.  The only reason the Moon looks bright is that
it's in bright sunlight against an otherwise-dark sky.  Evidently Heinlein
didn't know that...

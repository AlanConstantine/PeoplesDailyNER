That's assuming it could get built by them.

Of course,  it would probably sport Cruise missile Racks,
Sidewinder Missile tubes,  Bomb Points,  extra drop tanks,
a Full ECM suite, Terrain following radar  and stealth
materials.

IT might not fly,  but a technology demonstrator does
not require  actual flight.

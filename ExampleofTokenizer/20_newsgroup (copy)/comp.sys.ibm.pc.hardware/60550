The last I heard, the author was having some problems in his immediate
family and had delayed the continuation of development for a time.
This was some months ago.

It's a shame.  The driver is the best memory manager I have found
ANYWHERE.  It doesn't require V8086 mode (like QEMM) so it works with
Ultima 7.  It doesn't take ANY memory (runs, then exits).

If only the EMM provider were a little faster and more stable.

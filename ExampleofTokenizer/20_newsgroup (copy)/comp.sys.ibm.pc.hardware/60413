Hello,

I already tried our national news group without success.

I tried to replace a friend's original IBM floppy disk in his PS/1-PC
with a normal TEAC drive.
I already identified the power supply on pins 3 (5V) and 6 (12V), shorted
pin 6 (5.25"/3.5" switch) and inserted pullup resistors (2K2) on pins
8, 26, 28, 30, and 34.
The computer doesn't complain about a missing FD, but the FD's light
stays on all the time. The drive spins up o.k. when I insert a disk,
but I can't access it.
The TEAC works fine in a normal PC.

Are there any points I missed?

Thank you.
	Volkmar

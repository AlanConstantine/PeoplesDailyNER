The JP5 on the Speedstar 24x is for those systems with boot-up problems.
If your system fails to boot-up proprtly, please pull off the jumper
block from jp5. This will not affect the proformance of the SpeedStar 24x.
 
This is what my manual says about jp5. I never knew that it was there
but the card is a real ask kicker in my book. It beats the hell out
of my junk Sony 1604s to the point that I can't even use above 648x480
mode much...Sam
Some times an upgrage turns out to be a big overkill, like driving a Sony
with a 24x that the monitor can't handle. Or installing 60ns simms and
then finding out that your mother board doesn't have a cmos wait state
adjustment to take advantage of the new 60ns simms that you just bought!

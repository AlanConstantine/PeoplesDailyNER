newsgroup, listserver or reflector that you think might have a
group interested in this subject in order to reach as broad an
audience as possible. Every vote counts, so make sure you register
yours if you want these groups to be created.

Rationale
---------
The rationale for this proposal is a need for those interested or
involved in the publishing of cdrom materials to have a forum for
the discussion relating to their needs. At the moment the main fora
for such discussion are in alt.cd-rom and comp.multimedia neither
of which have publishing as their focus. Some lists serve the
general cdrom community with focuses on library, government and
network usage, and until several weeks ago none were devoted 
to publishing (CDPub has just been setup). In any case a list is not,
and ought not, be a replacement for regular usenet newsgroups.
 
The reason for the division into three groups is a natural
partition of interest between the hardware and software topics,
and between the two main focal points of software, i.e. fulltext
and multimedia publishing. Topics such as CDROM XA, CDI, CD-R, 
Photo CD and other related formats would be included as well. 
Topics related to cdrom publishing that are neither clearly
hardware or software related such as books, copyright issues and
other legal matters, packaging, distribution, could be included in
the purvue of comp.publish.cdrom.software, as would any other
nonhardware or multimedia topic that relates in some way to cdrom
publishing, in any format, and is appropriate to the Internet.
 
The main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.software would be topics such as
index and retrieval software, premastering software, cdrom
simulation software, hypertext, sgml, scanning and imaging
software, data capture software, data clean up, compression,
encryption etc as relates to publishing cdroms.
 
The main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia would be software that
aids in the multimedia authoring and publishing process - audio and
video.
 
The main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.hardware would be hardware that
relates to cdrom publishing, as well as hardware for data capture,
such as all sorts of scanners and data capture hardware, as well as
information that publishers need to know about the hardware that
the intended enduser will utilize (the hardware that will
eventually play the published cdrom) including networks for cdrom.
 
Notes
-----
These groups are not to be used for topics such as reviews or
questions relating to already published cdroms or reviews or
questions relating to general purpose cdrom drives and the like.
Requests for help in installing a cdrom drive and other general
topics should be directed to other fora. Questions about cdroms
mounted on LANs should be directed to bit.listserv.cdromlan.

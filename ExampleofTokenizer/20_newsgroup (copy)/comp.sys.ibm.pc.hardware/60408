Most of these are single-scan monitors, which are useless for most
PC users.  I posted requests for information in other newsgroups which
were mostly fruitless, but I have managed to track down two multisync
grayscal monitors in the 17-21" range, one 20" and one 21".  I am still
looking into it, and I will post the results when I get more info.
I am looking into a group purchase as well.

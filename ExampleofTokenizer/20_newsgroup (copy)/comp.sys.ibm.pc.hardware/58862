Thanks to all who responded to my original post.  I got the number for
Western Digital tech support and determined that I need to upgrade the
BIOS to the Super BIOS.  It will handle hard drives with up to 16 read/
write heads and up to 1024 cylinders.  The upgrade is $15, payable by
check or money order.  Send to:

	Western Digital Corporation
	Technical Support Group
	P.O. Box 19665
	Irvine, CA  92713-9665

The Super BIOS is for any WD XT hard drive controller card in the
WD1002 series.

The BIOS on my system would only handle up to 20mb drives.

The responses to my request for help follow my .sig.  Warning: It's long.

Keith

     Ah, finally a question I can answer.   I mess with this older
stuff alot.   Kinda fun.  8)

     First problem I can forsee is that the ST-251 will not be
compadible with that WD card unless it has the right bios rom.  

    Check the numbers on it.  It should be the only non-smt chip on
the board.  Slightly below center, and left.    The bios should read 
either :     62-000042-015 or
             62-000094-0x2

     If the last 3 digits are 013, you got problems.

>	W7	1 2 3

    Looks right.   W5 and W7 are factory jumped (with a trace) between
pins 1 and 2 to select the primary controller address.

>The drive jumpers are as follows: ("8" represents jumper)

    Looks right.

>Here are my questions:
>
>1.)	Are the drive and controller compatible w/ each other?

      I notice you left out the S1 jumper table settings.   Those are
what control what drive the controller thinks it has.   If you have
the 62-000042-015 rom, set it like this:

              5 + +    open
              6 + +    open             
              7 + +    open        
              8 + +    open
              4 + +    closed
              3 + +    closed
              2 + +    open
              1 + +    open

    Note:   those are how WD runs the numbers on the jumper block.
Top to bottom.   +'s represent the jumper pins.    Pins 3,4, and 8
select the first drive setting (drive 0) and pins 1,2 and 7 select the
second drive (drive 1).   

      If you have the 62-000094 rom, it's a auto-config, and I'll have
to look up how to do it... I don't have the big book right here.

>2.)	Are the jumpers on the card/drive set correctly?

      See above.  You might have problems if the S1 jumpers are not
right.   Also,  at the risk of being insulting, make sure the cables
are on right and good. 8).    On the jumper on the 251, try moving it
to the opposite side of the drive.    It's one or the other.   
     The narrow data cable goes to J2.   I've thrown it on J3 a few
times and banged my head for a day.....

>3.)	Is my system's BIOS in need of an upgrade?

     Dunno.    IBM roms had to be later than 10/27/82.   A quick way
to check is to boot dos and run debug.   Enter:
       
        -d f000:fff5 fffc    (the - is the debug prompt)
   
    This will return the rom date, if it's of any use.

>Keith Rice

      If I oversimplified any of the above, I appologize.     It's
just hard to know what caliber of person I'm talking to. 8).

If you are using a TWISTED 34-way cable then move the jumper 
on your drive to the neighbouring pins   :8::::::.  Make sure that
the twisted cable is for a hard disk (and not a floppy disk) - the
coloured stripe (pin 1) should be furthest from the twist.

This may also help.

          When using a Western Digital XT controller card the system will 
          not "boot."  To solve this problem, one of the ROM BIOS chips 
          must be disabled.  To disable the BIOS on your Western Digital  
          XT controller card, you must remove the jumper at position W-3 
          or add a jumper at position R-23 (depending on which model of XT 
          controller you are using).

          NOTE 2:  TANDY 1000 SYSTEMS - The WD1002A-WX1, WD1004A-WX1, 
          WDXT-GEN2 and the WD1004-27X can be modified to operate in 
          Tandy 1000 series computers, models SX, TX and the original or 
          "A" version.  These computers utilize an interrupt of 2 (IRQ2) 
          instead of IRQ5, the IBM standard.  To modify the WD1002A-WX1 or 
          the WD1002-27X to operate in these systems, you must cut the 
          etch between pin 1 and pin 2 at jumper position W-7.  Then 
          solder pin 2 and pin 3 at the position (W-7).  To complete the 
          modification, a jumper must be added to position 7 of switch S-1 
          (2 rows of 8 pins).  PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY PHYSICAL MODIFICATION 
          TO YOUR WESTERN DIGITAL HARD DISK CONTROLLER VOIDS THE WARRANTY 
          ON YOUR BOARD.  To modify the WD1004A-WX1, WDXT-GEN2 or the 
          WD1004-27X for your Tandy 1000 system, a zero ohm resister must 
          be soldered to jumper position W-27.  This will change the 
          interrupt from IRQ5 to IRQ2.

                floppy disk drive that may not be supported by your AT
                system ROM BIOS.  The optional ROM BIOS will also allow
                this controller card to operate high density floppy disk
                drives in an XT system.
                Feature F004 supports four floppy disk drives and includes
                an optional 37-pin control, data and power connector, an
                optional 4-pin power connector and a ROM BIOS that will

     HARD DISK CONTROLLERS FOR SCSI HARD DISK DRIVES
     
          
          7000-ASC - A SCSI host adapter that serves as an interface 
          between the AT bus and the SCSI bus.  All necessary drivers and 
          receivers are included, permitting direct cable connections to 
          the SCSI bus through a 50 pin connector and to the AT bus 
          through two edge connectors.  The 7000-ASC utilizes jumper  
          configurable options that enable the address space, DMA channels 
          and interrupt requests to be selected to suit the end user's 
          application.  The board also features word data transfer at 4 
          megabytes per second (synchronous), an on-board floppy disk 
          controller and a ROM BIOS.  Please note that the 7000-ASC 
          operates using standard DOS 3.2 or DOS 3.3 only.
          
          7000-FASST2 - This SCSI host adapter card provides the same 
          features as the 7000-ASC plus additional support capabilities 
          using software developed by Columbia Data Products.  The 7000-
          FASST2 will support MS-DOS 3.2-3.3, Compaq DOS 3.31, PC-DOS 4.0, 
          PC-MOS/386 version 2.1, XENIX, Microsoft Windows, Novell and 
          Sytos tape backup.
          
          WDATXT-FASST KIT - An "unintelligent" SCSI host adapter that is 
          compatible with the IBM XT, AT and compatible systems.  It uses 
          a 50 pin external SCSI bus "D" connector with a standard 50 pin 
          internal SCSI cable.  The WDATXT-FASST can be used as  both a 
          target and an initiator and it serves as an excellent tool for 
          SCSI designers.  It also provides a low cost alternative for end-
          users desiring to install a SCSI peripheral device such as a 
          hard disk drive or a tape backup unit. The kit includes an 8-bit 
          SCSI HBA board, manual, FASST software diskettes and an internal 
          SCSI cable.
          
          SYTOS TAPE BACKUP - (Utility for 7000-FASST) - FASST-SYTOS - 
          FASST version of Sytos tape backup utilities.  MS-DOS 
          compatible, it runs with FASST software products Revision 3.3+.

          WD1002A-FOX - Half-slot floppy disk controller for XT or AT 
          systems.  Four versions of the board are available:
                Feature F001 supports two floppy disk drives.
                Feature F002 supports four floppy disk drives and includes 
                an optional 37-pin control, data and power connector and 
                an optional 4-pin power connector.
                Feature F003 supports two floppy disk drives and includes 
                a ROM BIOS that will enable your system to recognize     
                floppy disk drives that may not be supported by your AT 
                system ROM BIOS.  The optional ROM BIOS will also allow 
                this controller card to operate high density floppy disk
                drives in an XT system.
                Feature F004 supports four floppy disk drives and includes 
                an optional 37-pin control, data and power connector, an 
                optional 4-pin power connector and a ROM BIOS that will 
                enable your system to recognize floppy disk drives that 
                may not be supported by your AT system ROM BIOS.  The 
                optional ROM BIOS will also allow this controller card to 
                operate high density floppy disk drives in an XT system.

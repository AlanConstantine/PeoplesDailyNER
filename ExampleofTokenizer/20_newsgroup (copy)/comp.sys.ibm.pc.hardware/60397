If you only do read/print then there is no reason for the joystick stuff
not to take 90% of the time even if it is efficient.

The truth is that int 15H joystick reading IS slow. I read it directly
from the hardware port. Note that doing so exposes you to intermittent
disturbance from interrupts, so you may want to read (say) twice in a
row and keep the lower results. Don't just turn interrupts off, it may
prove detrimental to the health of any high speed comms and other
devices.

Here is an example of how to do this:

/* ------------------------------ joy.c ------------------------------------- */

/* An example of how to read PC joystick port by polling the hardware port
 * directly.
 * Uses inp()/outp() for byte port access.
 * Will timeout when 'int count=0' counts up to zero.
 * This sample reads one port (A is presented and B is in the comments).
 * You can read both at once by merging the two, but it will time out
 * when either joystick is not connected.
 *
 * There is no need to optimize this routine since it runs for as long as
 * the joystick circuitry needs.

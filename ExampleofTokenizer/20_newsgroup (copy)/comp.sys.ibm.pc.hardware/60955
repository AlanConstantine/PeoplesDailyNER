I asked for opinions yesterday on Gateway machines. All
the e-mail I received indicated that they were solid,
reliable machines and technical support was very good.

Well, Gateway faxed me a price sheet just now. It seems
to be on the higher side, but then again, maybe not.
Dell's price for a similar price is a whole lot more.
Is this a decent deal? Please advise via email!

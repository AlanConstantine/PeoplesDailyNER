I know this isn't the EXACT right place to put this, but im desperate!

I'll be going home for the summer, and wont have direct access to my
VAX account....My problem is, i need a service that doesn't charge body
parts, vital organs, or my first born son, that allows me access to the
internet!  All i really need is to be able to TELNET to my school account,
and from there I can do anything I need to do.   ANY HELP WILL BE GREATLY
APPRECIATED!!!!!!!!!!!

Please! E-MAIL to DFMORGAN@acs.harding.edu

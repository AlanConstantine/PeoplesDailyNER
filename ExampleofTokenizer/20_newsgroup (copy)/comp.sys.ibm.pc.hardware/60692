For those of you who might be familiar with Insight Distribution
     Network, Inc. and their Multimedia Kits:

I'm seriously considering buying the Insight Talon TA-2000 MM Kit, which
is bundled with the CD-ROM drive with 265-280ms access time, 300Kb dtr,
multispin, multi-session Photo CD capability, etc., and with the PAS-16
sound card, etc.... (if you are familiar with Insight, you know the kit
I mean).  I believe the drive is either a Texel (265ms) or an NEC
(280ms), but it is not clear to me which one is actually a part of the
bundle (at least two of their sales people couldn't give me a straight
answer as to which one; ah, yes, one of the drawbacks of OEM!).

Other questions:

- Excuse my ignorance, but is "Texel" a reputable maker in the CD-ROM
  market?  Or do you think NEC is the better drive?

- Bottom line:  Is this kit worth the money?  (Currently, $449 for the
  TA-1000, and $699 for the TA-2000)

Alternatively, I was thinking that the TA-2000 might be overkill for my
uses (however, I *do* want full multimedia capabilities, Photo CD stuff,
educational programs for my kids, etc.), and considered the lower-end
TA-1000 kit and using the difference (around $250.00) to get something
else useful, like a tape back-up drive unit.

Basically, I would just like to hear from those who have actually USED
these kits, and whatever pros/cons you might advise, preferably
directly to the email address below.

Thanks,

Koji

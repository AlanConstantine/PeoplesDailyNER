Once again, someone else with a Gateway Monitor problem, anyone who can
help, please do, it would be much apprieciated.  Thanks in advance.

Ok, I have a Local Bus 486/66 machine, with the Crystal Scan 15inch
monitor.  I have 1 meg of loca memory on the ATI ultra pro, w/ the
mach32 driver (the newest release).

My problem is in Windows when I use the 1024 mode. I get shadows down
the sides of the screens, and very blurry type in the corners.  The
types on the screen are all out of focus. I've gotten replacement video
cards, and a replacement monitor.  None of that has helped though.
Could someone pleae help me with this very frustruating problem.

Thanks again,
Josh Smith

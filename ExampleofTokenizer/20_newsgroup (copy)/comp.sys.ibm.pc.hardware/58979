Could anybody please provide me a copy of the Windows 3.1 drivers and grabbers
from Orchid Technologies for use with their ProDesigner IIs ISA video card? Currently I do not have access to a modem to dial out to Orchid BBS.
If you can help me, please do any of the following, wichever is most convenient
to you:

1)
Copy the binary files to a directory readable by any user in any cell of the
Andrew File System

2)
Upload the binary files to an anonymous FTP site (where allowed).

3)
uuencode the files and send them to me by electronic mail.

Please notify me by electronic mail at
towwang@caen.engin.umich.edu

Thanks in advance.

Francisco

Hi! I recently got hold of an old/obsolete PC. First thing I am trying to do
with it, is making it work. Seems the switches in the back have been toggled
since last it was used, and I do not have the manual.
Can anybody help me to identify this beast, and mail me the prober switch-settings?
All I know is that is is a Bondwell 38, made in 1986, most likely a 286,
can be toggled between 4.77 and 8 mHz, and looks like no changes have been made.
Any information would be appreciated.

   On a few computers which we have here at Sheridan College there are
files which we would like to make read only.  I have used the Dos attrib command
but some people, who carry around the attrib program in their pockets,
have still been able to erase some of the more important files.  Are
there any software packages which would make an entire drive read-only?
An example, partition the drive into two partitions and have the first
drive contain the important files which can be only read and the second
drive you could both read and write.  
  Any and all enquiries or help would be appreciated.

thanx.

Subject: Quantum 240AT: is my cache working?

The Quantum LPS 240AT is supposed to have a 256K cache on the IDE
controller built into the card.  Yet when I do a DOS DIR command
on my system, the disk is always accessed (I can hear the mechanical
movement of the heads).  Why is this happening?  Strangely, even
when I have smartdrive installed, every DIR command accesses the
disk.  Did I somehow de-activate the cache?  This is happening on each 
of two machines with an LPS 240AT drive.

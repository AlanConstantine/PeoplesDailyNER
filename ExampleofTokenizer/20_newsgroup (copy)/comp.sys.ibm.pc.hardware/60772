I have a new monitor which I set up approximately 3-4 feet from 
where the AC power enters my house - at my fuse box. 

Is this safe for the monitor, or will/can the EMF emitted by the AC current eventually affect my monitor?  If so, how, and is the 
damage permanent or would degaussing fix it?

Thanks,
Tom Catalino

Andrew, yes there is a DX and DX2 version of the 50MHz 486.  If you are 
considering buying one or the other, definitely go for the DX with a nice 
size external cache!  The performance is far greater.

The DX2 only has the internal 8k cache to work with at 50MHz, while the DX 
has a potentially much larger cache to work at 50MHz with.  Neither 
systems could actually run a program out of main memory, since DRAM is 
still too slow for that high of bus speed ( 60ns = 16.66MHz < 50MHz ).

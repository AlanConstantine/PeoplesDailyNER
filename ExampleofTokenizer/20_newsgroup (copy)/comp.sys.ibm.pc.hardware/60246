I have some used, but working, parts available for the original IBM
laptop - the PC Convertible.  If you have one of these things, and
still are using it, you may have found out that IBM wants OUTRAGEOUS
prices for parts.  I built up a supply of enough parts to keep mine
going for a few years, and will be willing to part with the rest.

Basically, I have all the standard parts EXCEPT:

Motherboard
Battery
Power Supply

I've got a few of the accessories, too - just ask.

These are in very limited supply, however.  I've basically just cannibalized
a couple of old machines.

If you are interested, please e-mail me.

Note: For those who want to convince themselves that they are somehow
superior because they have newer and better machines, or who want to
inform me that these are "worthless junk," save your effort.  I'll
just delete the note.  Those of us who bought these machines when they first
came out still find them useful for word processing, etc..  I'm saving
mine as a future antique.

I ran out of time on my last reply to this string and I don't
know if it was sent or not but. I have never heard of anyone that
had to return something in the 30 grace peried that had a problem
at all with Midwest Micro. They may of thought that you didn't
know what you were doing and suggested how to correct the problem.
But it sounded as you didn't give them much of a chance to correct
things at all. The fact that the PPI worked okay for you is because
it is setup more for the no nothing user that can't understand the
instruction and the commands to configure it to his/her system.
When you find out things like the fact the the EC led that looks like
you have connected to another EC modem, doesn't realy say that.
But that it only tells you that you have EC turned on, on your modem.
I think that these LED are nothing more that just light to hype up
the product. Just like I bet someone took home a few extra $$$
in the last year for giving the PPI modems the PC-Magazine award
of the year. Not so for the stash (12) of them that I saw on my test
bench. I could go on for hours at no end as to all of the problems
that I found with the PPI modems but I will try to control myself.
I will not even go into the 6 weeks it took PPI to credit my card
back for the modems after they had received them back...no I will
not go into that one nor will I go into talking to the parent co.
co from Hayes. I'll just say I hope you like your new modem and
maybe someone that can understand how to setup a modem will get
the one that you sent back, maybe a good friend of mine I hope!

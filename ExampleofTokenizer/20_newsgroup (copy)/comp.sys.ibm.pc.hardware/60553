I also have a DX2/66 and a Maxtor 212. I have a local bus IDE controller (generic) and I get
985 KB/s. I tried swapping my local bus IDE controller for an ISA IDE controller and my
transfer rate went to 830 KB/s. The specs for this drive show a maximum platter to controller
transfer rate of 2.83 MB/s. I dont know how to get there from here. The local bus interface
got me a little, but certainly not as much as I had hoped. I am also looking for a way to 
improve my disk performance, but Im not convinced that the controller is the bottleneck
(although Im willing to entertain the possibility that it is). I am already running a big
main memory disk cache, so Im not really interested in this solution either.

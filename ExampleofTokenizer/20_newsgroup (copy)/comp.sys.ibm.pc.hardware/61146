I have two UN-opened, NEW Epson Action Printers 2250 for sale.  
List price at CompUSA is $169, I'm asking $100 + shipping for each.

My friend and I got the printers at a promotional event at one of
the CompUSA stores near our area.  We didn't need printers, so we're 
selling it.

Prints on letterhead
Small footprint (Can be used either flat or upright!)

Trades are welcome!!!

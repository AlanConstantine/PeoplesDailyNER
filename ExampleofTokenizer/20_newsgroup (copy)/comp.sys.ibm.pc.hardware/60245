Computer: 286-25 mhz
Bus: ISA (12.5 mhz)
Drive: Maxtor 7213A (213 mb)

                                    config.sys / autoexec.bat

                     MS DOS 5             no           WIN 3.1
                     smartdrv.sys        cache         smartdrv.exe

CORE (V 2.7)         6950 k/sec          1390 k/sec     1395 k/sec
Norton SI (V 5.0)     730 k/sec           980 k/sec      982 k/sec

I'd still like to here from people with VLB-IDE.
I still want to know what VLB bus speed is used with IDE drives.
I still want to know if some (most ?) IDE drives can handle bus speeds > 8 mhz.

PS: A friend with a 286-20 and a new Maxtor 7245 (245 meg IDE) drive gets
between 800 - 1000 k/sec (can't remember exactly).  I think the bus is running
at 8 mhz in this case.

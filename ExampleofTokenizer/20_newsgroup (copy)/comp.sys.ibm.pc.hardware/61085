Subject: HELP: LED connectors for motherboard
Date: Thu Apr 22 09:02:48 1993


I bought a 386DX-40 motherboard for 50$... no documentation at all. Everything
appears to work, except I'm having trouble getting a few of the LED connectors
working. I've looked at the manuals for 4 other motherboards, but the pin
configuration doesn't look anything like what is on this board. Does this
pin arrangement look familiar to anyone out there??? Any hints on where I
can find this information?

                 1                 10
      "speaker"  . . . . . . . . . .
      "keylock"  . . . . . . . . . .
                 11          ^     20
                       J23   |
                             |The board came with a jumper vertically across
                              these two pins.

I can get the power/keylock to work across pins 11-15, reset across pins 9 and
Shown 82%, press <SPACE> for more, 'q' to quit, or 'h' for help
                                                                                
19, but would prefer not to blow something up by further experimentation.
The date on the board itself is 6/92, opti chips.

I would really appreciate any help, and thank you in advance.

Nicji,
It would realy realy help if you said what chipset and if the board
was an upgradable or not board and how old it and the bios is???

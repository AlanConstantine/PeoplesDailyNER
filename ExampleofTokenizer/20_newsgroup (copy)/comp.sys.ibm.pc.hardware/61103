If you bought your IDE drive from a dealer, you shouldn 't have to 
perform a low level format. Even if the 1st HD is already partitioned
into C and D, FDISK will automatically assign the 2 nd HD to D and 
change the 2nd partition of 1st drive to E.

Check the jumper settings and CMOS setup, in particular the correct
number of cylinders and tracks

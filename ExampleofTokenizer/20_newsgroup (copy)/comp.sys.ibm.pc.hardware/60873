I have a Leading edge 486sx25 with 4 Megs of RAM that are in the forms of  
4 1 meg SIMMS.  Each SIMM has *two* chips on it. They are manufactured by  
Samsung and are 80ns.  A salesman told me that the leading edge CPC-2300  
motherboard has the extra parity bit built in and reccomemnded I use MAC  
SIMMS. I tried using 4 Megs pulled out of a Mac SI (these are 8 chip  
SIMMS), but I got too many windows protection faults and parity errors. I  
guess I should use the same SIMMS as the ones I have, but I can't find  
any!! Most of the places I have called carry only 3 8 or 9 chip SIMMS.

So if anybody knows where I can get memory that is good with my computer  
or if you have any suggestions at all, please let me know.

Any help is truly appreciated.

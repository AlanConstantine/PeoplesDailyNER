  I am unable to get my Gateway 486DX2/66 to run Windows
in 1280x1024.  I ordered a 2M ATI Ultra Pro, and I'm pretty
sure the 2M is really there because I *can* select
1024x768x65536.   But no matter what I do with the Flex program
in the ATI's program group, 1280x1024 remains ghosted out.
I have Windows 3.1, build 59 of the drivers, DOS 5.0.  The
drivers were installed by Gateway, not by me, so perhaps there's
a file missing from the hard drive.  It runs 1024x768 just fine.
  I did go into the Desktop window and select 1280x1024.  Sometimes
it refuses (ghosted out), other time it accepts it, but when I hit
OK and re-enter Desktop, it's back to 1024x768.  At no time does
it unghost 1280x1024 in the main Flex window.  Help!

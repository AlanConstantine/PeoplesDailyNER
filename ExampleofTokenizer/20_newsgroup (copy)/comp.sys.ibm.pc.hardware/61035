Just curious why floptical drives never seemed to catch on. Remember
those 21 Mb disks that look and feel like 3.5" floppies? These drives
are SCSI devices and can read and write both 720 Kb and 1.44/21 Mb
disks. Sounds to me to be one great product for the PC market. Are the
prices really that unaffordable compared to CD-ROMs which are currently
not rewritable? I know about the new rewritable CDs and expect SONY to
develop the first MDs for the computer. My question is: why isn't there
any substantial interest in developing the flopticals?

Just a thought.

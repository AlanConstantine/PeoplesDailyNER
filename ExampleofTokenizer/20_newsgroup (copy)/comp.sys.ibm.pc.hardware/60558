Well, I was told that my last message came through without anything
in it, so I'll try again.

I have a Leading Edge 386SX 16 with a flaky motherboard and a friend
game me one to replace it, but he didn't have any docs for the 
mother board.  It's a CHEERTRON board with Award bios and has a   
sticker on it that says VI 1   T1 3  T2 3  on it.  I can tell what
most of the switches on the blue blocks mean.  except FDC and
SH, but I have no idea about all the jumpers.  I've replaced hard
drives and modems and installed math co-processes, but this is a
bit out of my league and without the docs, I'm really lost.

If anyone could give me some help on this, I'd really appreciate
it.  I don't get on news regularly, so if you can help, please
e-mail me at passman@world.std.com

Thanks.

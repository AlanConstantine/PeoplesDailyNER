I have been able to successfully use both 16 and 24 bit color modes on my
Gateway system, although my setup is less complicated than yours.  It sounds as
if you may have a hardware conflict or problem.  Is your memory aperture above
16M?  I have heard rumors of incompatibilities with that SCSI card with a
variety of systems.  Call up Gateway and give them hell until they help you
fix it.

Which bus???

I think there are several reasons :-

50MHz motherboards are harder to get right
50MHz need a fast L2 cache - 12-15ns is a good idea
50MHz needs to be slowed down to make a compliant VESA bus
66MHz DX2 chips are faster for a lot of things


With a good, fast L2 cache a DX2/66 is going be be faster than a DX50...

What do I have?

A DX50 of course!

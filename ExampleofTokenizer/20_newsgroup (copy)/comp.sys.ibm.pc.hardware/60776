folks,

I have a Panasonic kx-1124 (just inherited with no documentation) which is 
giving me a problem that i cant resolve.

 The paper out light refuses to go out . It starts to blink when ever i
turn the power on which 2 beeps. It does allow be to go on line with green
light lit, simultanously the red paper out light also remains lit -but is
does not blink.

 Please do not give any references to manuals , as i dont have any.

Thanking you all very much in advance.

Sincerely

Dharmesh

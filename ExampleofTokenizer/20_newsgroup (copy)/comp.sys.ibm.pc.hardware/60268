Hi...I need some info on video card.  I am looking a video card that can
deliver a high quality picture.  I need the card to display images (well
for advertising company btw), so it must be rich with colors and the speed
must be fast too.

I am just wondering if somebody can advise me what to buy for such
application, and possible the address of the vendor.

thanks in advance
Glenn Jayaputera

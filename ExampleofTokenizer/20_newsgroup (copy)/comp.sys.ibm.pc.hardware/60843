Most XT IDE controllers are responsible for keeping track of the drive
geometry and getting the information to the computer.  The controller may
come with software to update its on-board BIOS, or may be designed to work
with a particular drive.  Seagate drives usually have special controllers
for use on XT's, and these are tailored to the drive.

Also, you cannot low-level format an IDE drive.  The low-level format is
stored on specal magnetic areas on the disk surface called "servos" (not
like the electronic use of the term) that need a higher recording bias than
the drive's recording heads can generate.  Don't try to low-level format an
IDE drive!

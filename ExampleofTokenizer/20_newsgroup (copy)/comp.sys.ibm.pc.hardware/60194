Hi,

I'm kind of new at the pc stuff.  My machine has 4 serial ports.  Com 1 and3
and 2 &4 share same IRQs.  You mean I can't plug a mouse into Com1 and a modem
into com3 and expect both to work?

If Answer is NO, should I change IRQ's for com ports to be different?  And,
does it really matter which IRQ I set the ports too?

Phil

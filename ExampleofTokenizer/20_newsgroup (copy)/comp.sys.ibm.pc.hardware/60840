When a program uses a DOS call to get the system, it resets the flag that
tells the BIOS that it has passed midnight.  It then uses this flag to
increment the date.  If the menu does a call to the system to get the time
before midnight, before the BIOS sees the midnight flag, then BIOS will not
know that the day passed and the date will not get updated.

I might have some DOS's and BIOS's mixed up (darned cold messed up my
brains) but this has been a well documented problem for years.  I don't know
of a workaround.  Hope this helps!

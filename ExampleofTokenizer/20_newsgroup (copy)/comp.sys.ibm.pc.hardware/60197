In PC Magazine April 27, 1993:29 "Although SCSI is twice as fasst as ESDI,
20% faster than IDE, and support up to 7 devices its acceptance ...has
long been stalled by incompatability problems and installation headaches."
note what it does NOT site as a factor: PRICE.
int eh same article the PC would will get plug and play SCSI {from the
article it seems you get plug and play SCSI-1 only since SCSI-2 in FULL
implimentation has TEN NOT 7 devices.}
SCSI-1 intergration is sited as another part of the MicroSoft Plug and play
program.

I don't know which tube the Viewsonic 17 uses, but it has an 82khz horizontal
bandwidth so you can go pretty high.  I ran mine at 1280x1024x75 which was as
fast as the Orchid P9000 could drive it.  Also, the 17 does claim to be able
to support 1600x1280, but I have no experience with that.

Since I have the spec sheet in front of me I'll type some in:

CRT:	17", 0.28 mm dot pitch, 90 deg deflection, RGB mediou short
	persisance, Tint (TM=52%), anti-static, anti-glare, anti-reflection

Input Signal:  RGB Analog 0.7Vp-p, 75 ohms (also has setting for 1Vp-p)
	Sync: H/V Separate(ttl), composite (+/-), sync on green (+/-)
	horizontal freq: 30-82Khz, vertical freq: 50-90Hz
compatibility: PC from VGA to 1600x1280 non-interlaced, mac IIci and above
controls: contrast, brightness, position, size, degauss, p-p voltage, color
	temp, sync select, color tuning, moire on/off.
video band witdth: 135 MHz
Max brightness: 120 cd/m2 at white flat field
misconvergence: .35mm (max) at center, .45mm (max) at corner
dimensions: 16.3"x16.22"x17.64", weight 42.6 lbs

I don't know what some of those mean and don't verify their accuracy, I just 
typed them in.  Other things they hype on the sheet are a 'double quaduple
dynamic astigmatism focus'.  Right.  They mean they use two lenses.  Advanced
Invar shadow mask.  ViewMatch color control which they claim is and easy-to-use
system that adjusts colors to closely match printer output.  As near as I have
been able to figure out, this translates to separate controls for red, green,
and blue.  How this makes it easy to match for printer output is beyond me.

But beyond the hype, the monitor is very pleasant to look at.  Sharp, clear,
and isn't nearly as bad as the NEC's for reflections.

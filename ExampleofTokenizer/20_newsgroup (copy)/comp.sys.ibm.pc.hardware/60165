I am doing a report on the topic of 'Advanced Memory Management' and
need to know of some good references to cover this topic.  It is an 
Analytical Chemistry class on Instrumental Analysis.  So, as you 
could guess, it doesn't have to be an extremely thorough or extensive
covering of the topic.  Also, I am a Chemical Engineer and know some,
but not too much about memory management.  If anyone could help point 
me in a good direction I would be very thankful.

Thanks in advance.

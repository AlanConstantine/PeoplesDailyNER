Anyone who knows this answer off-hand, please answer me by e-mail 
quickly ;). 

There is a pair of jumpers on one side, and a set of 3 or 4 on the
other end.  One is labeled, sync , and one CD, and E0 E1 E2.  

Whhich do I need to short, or disconnect to get drive to operate
in slave mode?  Give me a label or "geographic
label, as they have quite a few jumpers, and I don't wanna try the
trial and error method... 

I am using IDE. I think this drive is SCSI compatible too.

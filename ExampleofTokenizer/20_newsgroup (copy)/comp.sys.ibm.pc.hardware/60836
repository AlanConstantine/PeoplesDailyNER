I have a 486DX-33 ISA pc-compatible (Insight) with an Infotel internal
14.4FAX/14.4data modem with QuickLinkII for Windows.  When I first put the
modem in, I pulled a phone out of the jack in another room, and ran a phone
line extension to my surge protector and then my computer.  The modem
worked fine.  Then I split the line from the jack in the other room, ran
the line into my room into the surge protector and up to my computer.  Then
I got a regular phone and plugged that into the phone jack in the modem.
Now when I try to use the modem, QuickLinkII says "No dialtone".  The phone
plugged into the back of the computer works fine.  I tried unplugging the
phone, but still no dice.  Is it that the phone line was split too many
times?  (I don't understand how this could be a problem, since the phone
worked fine.)  Please note: none of the software or hardware parameters
were changed, only the phone line itself.  Is my new modem faulty?  What
can I do?

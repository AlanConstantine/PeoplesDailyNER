Hi, I need some advice from the netland in selecting a sound card.

I am about to buy a sound card for my kid. I don't know which one to buy.
Which one to select from the following list:

- Sound Blaster 16
- Miscrosoft- sound card
- Audio Spectrum
- Sound Blaster pro
- Sound Blaster


My allocated budget is around $250.


Could some of you know about sound cards help me to select the most appropriate
one for my kid ?


I have 486-33 Mz OPTI MB.
I also have NEC CDROM that I would like to connect to the sound card.


Thank you.

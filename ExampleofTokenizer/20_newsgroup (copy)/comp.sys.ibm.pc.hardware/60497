Hi all,

  I would like to purchase CD-ROM drive. The specs I would like to have is:

   * Applicable to Kodak multisession Photo-CD
   * SCSI(2) Interface
   * Compatible with Adaptec-1542B
   * Does not need any caddies
   * Cheaper ( < $500 if possible)
   * Double Speeded

  I believe there are no drives satisfying all of the above condition,
  so I would like to know all of your opinion.  The above conditions
  are sorted by my priority.
  I think NEC CDR74-1/84-1 is a little bit expensive, but it DOES satisfy
  almost all of the above conditions. The problem is that I do not know
  the compatibility with 1542B. Has someone succeeded to connect these
  NEC drives to 1542B? I have heard a rumor that NEC drive is incompatible
  with 1542B adapter.
  Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance,
Kobayashi,Masaoki

How long does he have to take in fixing it?  Does he have to use new
parts when he repairs it or can he substitute used parts without your
knowledge?  Can he charge you for repairs that should be under warranty
but he claims are due to improper maintenance on your part? 

When it comes to local dealers:

- Have fun getting consistently good support.  Most of their "techs" are
re-treaded salesmen, not trained technicians, with a high turnover rate.

- Have fun getting in-warranty work done quickly and courteously.

- Have fun getting out-of-warranty work done cheaply, or even done
period, unless you are on a paid service contract.

Having been both a service technician, and a service manager, at a
ComputerLand franchise and another retail computer place, I know what
I'm talking about. 

I also know the "local service" scam that retail computer dealers like
to push when they're selling.  It's that same old song that car dealers
having been singing for years -- "Buy from me and you'll get good
service. We always treat our customers right!  Buy from my competition
and you'll be sorry if you need service." 

Experienced mail order buyers know that there are some mail order
companies that give excellent service, including overnight replacement parts, 
on-site calls, etc. There are probably some local dealers that can give you
good service, too. But if you think all local dealers give consistenly good 
service, you are wrong.  I have many anectdotes to prove my point, 
but I'm sure there are others on the net can do a better job than I can.

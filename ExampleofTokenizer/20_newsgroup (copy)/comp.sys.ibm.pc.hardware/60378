Hi world,
        
        I want to buy a Spirit II 14400 Data/Fax modem (made in U.S.A.).
Have anyone heard about it or using it? What is it's performance? Is it
stable or not? Please give me some advice.
 
        In addition, I heard a news from local distributor that a new
28800baud CCITT ROM (the distributor said it will be the new CCITT 
standard.) for this modem will be produced at the end of this 
year. After replaced the old ROM by this 28800 ROM, this Spirit II can
transfer data at 28800baud without any hardware alternation. Is this 
new true and possible? Would the telephone line really able to transfer 
at such high speed? Please give me some advice.
 
        At last, can anyone tell me how to contact with the central 
dealer QuickComm. Inc.? (I am not sure whether it in U.S.A. or not.)
Please leave me a e-mail.
 
Thank you very much.

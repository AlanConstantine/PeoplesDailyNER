Subject: Do the 2MB ATI Ultra Pro 16 and 24 bit Windows Drivers Work?

Hi there.  We just bought a 486 DX2/66 Gateway system with a 2 meg ATI
Ultra Pro video card.  Everything seems to work fine except for the
Windows Drivers for 800x600 24 bit, and 800x600 and 1024x768 16 bit
modes.  The fonts and icons start deteriorating after windows startup,
and within minutes of use, everything on the screen is totally
unintelligible.  Naturally, I called Gateway tech support to inquire
about this.  The technician asked me about the drivers, and I told him it
was version 1.5, build 59.  He told me that the 16 and 24 bit drivers for
the ATI Ultra Pro simply do not work!!!  Is this true?  If so, I'm simply
amazed.  How could this be?  The strange thing is I would have expected
to see some discussion on here (unless the subject has made the FAQ!!!).

One very suspicious point that came up later was that he stated that none
of the Windows Accelerator boards have working 16 and/or 24 bit drivers
for Windows 3.1.  I easily challenged him on that because I've been
running a Diamond 24x in 15 bit mode at home for 4 months now, and I have
tested and used the 24 bit mode as well.  He then backed off and said:
"Well, Diamond has been working on those drivers much longer."  Anyway, I
just wanted to see if anyone else had any trouble and what they did about
it.  Any feedback will be appreciated.

The system configuration is:

Gateway 486 DX2/66 Local Bus
16 Megs Ram
SCSI HD & CD-ROM
Ultrastor 34F Local Bus SCSI controller
ATI Ultra Pro Local Bus with 2MB VRAM
DOS 6.0
Windows 3.1
Mach 32 drivers version 1.5 (build 59)

Thanks in advance.

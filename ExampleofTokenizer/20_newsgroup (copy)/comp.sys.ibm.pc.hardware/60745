   You might try asking on one of the comp.sys.ibm.* echos (the best one
may be comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware).  I say this because the conversion
seems more geared toward a PC user wanting to use that monitor, than
an Atari user who already can use the monitor (unless maybe they
want to really go wild - converting the monitor to VGA, then
using it as a VGA monitor with a Falcon :-)

   As for graphics cards, assuming that the Atari monitor can be
modified/adapted to handle VGA signals, you should probably be able
to use any VGA card (at least with a res around 640x400).  I haven't
tried this, but that would be my guess...

...you might want to price mono VGA monitors anyways - it may be cheaper
to go that route than to do the conversion; besides, with the Falcon and
beyond, VGA/SVGA/multisync monitors will probably be the way to go...

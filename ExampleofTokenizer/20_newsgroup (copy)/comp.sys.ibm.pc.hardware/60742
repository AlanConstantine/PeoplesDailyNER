I have a DFI Handy Scanner Model HS-3000Plus and a little bit of
software running under dos to use it. I'd like to make more extensive
use of this device (in particular, write a driver for it on unix).

So, can anyone give me a description of how to talk to this device. It
connects to the system via it's own interface card.

Any info would help, it can't be too difficult to talk to :-)

thanks, brian wallis...

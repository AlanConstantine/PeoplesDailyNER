I own an 80386sx, 16Mhz, 2Mb ram machine and am finding it too slow for
certain games such as X-wing. I was in a Computer store there the other
day and saw a series of Gamecards which claim to speed up your machine
to up to 80Mhz! I was wondering if anyone out there who has a similar
machine had bought one or seen one of these Gamecards and whether or not
they do actually work!
	Any help here would be much appreciated,
		Thanks in advance,
			Greg.

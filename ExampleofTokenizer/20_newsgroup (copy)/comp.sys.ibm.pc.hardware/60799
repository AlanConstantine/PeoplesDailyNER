This is a fundamental aspect of Novell's business; they wouldn't be
where they are if they didn't live up to their "Novell Does Printing"
slogan.  We run 6 printers of varying types off our Novell network;
I'm sure there are places with hundreds.

RTFM on the CAPTURE command, PRINTCON, PSERVER, and the sections of
the Windows 3.1 manual which cover network printing.  If you haven't bought
Novell's products yet, rephrase your question and look for information about
how *well* various competitors do printing.

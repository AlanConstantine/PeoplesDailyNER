	Actually there is an S3-based card on the market that supports
	multiple adapters in one system. Unfortunately, It is VL-Bus
	only (They may have an ISA version by now...?) from a company
	called Metheus. The address and phone number is:

			Metheus Corp
			OGC Science Park
			1600 NW Compton Dr.
			Beaverton, OR  97006-6905
			(503)-690-1550
	Be aware, this is a very high-end card, capable of 4MB of VRAM,
	so it does not come CHEAP. But, I have personally seen TWO of
	these boards running a dual screen Windows 3.1.

I recently purchased the then current Pkg.# 486dx-33 for $2395 (but changed
to NEC 3FGx monitor upgrade). Buy this Pkg. #3 now - for $100 more, you now
get a bigger HD - 340mb with @256 HD cache. 30 days ago, when I bought this
pkg., it was 245mb with @132K HD cache. This is a great deal although it is
generally recommended you at least upgrade to the 15' Zeos (CTX) monitor for
$99 more I believe.  Whether you also upgrade to the Diamond Viper video
card is your choice. I stayed with the Diamond Speedstar Pro. Zeos Tech
Support is really good - call after normal business hours to get the 
fastest access. The hardest part about buying a Zeos is the wait till it is
delivered - once you order you can hardly wait to get it! There are quite a
few good mail order houses around - lots of bang for buck with Zeos.

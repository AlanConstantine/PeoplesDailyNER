I would like advice on how to configure my 486 to accept:
- Com1 + Com2  (currently on IRQ 4 and 3)
- LPT1 (IRQ7)
- Bus Mouse (IRQ5)
- Sound Card (no idea what to do - can be set to any)
- 
using IRQ2 for Bus MOuse gobbled up too many cycles, and caused
loss of communications with floppy disks, and a few other 
problems.

I could, I suppose, switch the 2 com devices externally, and disable
the second port on the Super IO card, but I really want to 
have them both available.

COuld the sound card use IRQ2 without horsing up the works?

All replies apppreciated - and I only just subscribed to this
newsgroup - I assume there is an FAQ somewhere (rather, I'm
sure someone will tell me about it....)

thanks

	I'm trying to transfer some software between two machines 
	and I'm having real trouble.  My own Intel 14.4k (
	v32/v32bis/v42/v42bis) works fine--I just talk to it
	at 56k and everything comes out clear.  This other modem,
	at the other machine, is a "Turbomodem+" from "The 
	Complete PC" (the machines are in seperate houses, 
	so a direct serial link is impossible, and copying this
	much data to disk is a pain--easier to turn the machines
	on for a few hours and go see a movie--no, this is not
	pirated software).

	I am having no end of trouble trying to set it up.  It will
	dial and connect just fine--at 9600 baud.  But if I try to
	set the comm at 19k2, 38.4k or 56kbps, the stupid thing
	connects, but just gives garbage (it connects 14.4k).  
	His machine (a dx48633) has a 16550AFN UART, so that's
	not the problem.

	It seems to me that the stupid thing wants to talk to 	
	a comm program _at_ 14.400bps, even though it will take
	dialing instructions at 56k (and respond OK, etc. to 
	other commands).  I don't have a comm program that can
	do precisely 14.4k.  

	I looked at the manual but it was unclear.  All I know is,
	I didn't have this trouble with the Intel--it came
	ready to connect this way.  Do I need to initialize it
	any way in particular?

	Also, it's _using_ V.42bis and V.42 (and MNP5) when connecting
	here (i.e., at 9600, since our tests at 14k4 are zip so far)
	but it doesn't _say_ so there.  any ideas?

	(BTW:  I tried the initialization string that I use for
	my modem, but it just gives ERROR on that one)

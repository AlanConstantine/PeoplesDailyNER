I received a Kaypro 286i computer (DOS) without a manual that 
describes the jumpers on the motherboard.  It came with
640KB and I up'd it to 1MB.  But the computer or setup does not
recognize the extra 384K. 

Does anyone know if this computer is capable of greater than 640K
on the main board and what jumpers are required to expand it to 1MB?

Some specs:
	Kaypro main board assy number 81-621
	Phoenix BIOS v1.51 1985

Thanks in advance,
Doug

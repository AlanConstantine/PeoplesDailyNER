Hi Netters!

I'm looking at purchasing some sort of backup solution.  After you read about
my situation, I'd like your opinion.  Here's the scenario:

1.  There are two computers in the house.  One is a small 286 (40MB IDE drive).
    The other is a 386DX (213 SCSI drive w/ Adaptec 1522 controller).  Both 
    systems have PC TOOLS and will use Central Point Backup as the backup / 
    restore program.  Both systems have 3.5" and 5.25" floppies.

2.  The computers are not networked (nor will they be anytime soon).

From what I have seen so far, there appear to be at least 4 possible
solutions (I'm sure there are others I haven't thought about).  For these 
options, I would appreciate hearing from anyone who has tried them or sees 
any flaws (drive type X won't coexist with device Y, etc.) in my thinking 
(I don't know very much about these beasts):

1.  Put 2.88MB floppy drives (or a combination drive) on each system.
    Can someone supply cost and brand information?  What's a good brand?
    What do the floppies themselves cost?


2.  Put an internal tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter, and
    continue to back up the 286 with floppies.  Again, can someone recommend a
    few manufacturers?  The only brand I remember is Colorado Memories.  Any
    happy or unhappy users (I know about the compression controversy)?
 

3.  Connect an external tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter, and
    (maybe?) connect it to the 286 somehow (any suggestions?)


4.  Install a Floptical drive in each machine.  Again, any gotcha's or 
    recommendations for manufacturers?  

I appreciate your help.  You may either post or send me e-mail.  I will
summarize all responses for the net.

Thanks,

George

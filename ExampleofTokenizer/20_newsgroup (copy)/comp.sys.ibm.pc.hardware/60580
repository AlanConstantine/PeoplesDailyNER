B(>i am interested in getting the pulse of this group regarding
B(>extended operation of my G2K 486-33V with the cover removed
B(>from the enclosure.  there are a # of reasons i am considering
B(>this, including quick access to jumpers during complex i/o card
B(>setups.

B(>my concern is that without a complete enclosure to direct the
B(>cooling flow of air from the fan, "hot spots" may develop on my
B(>motherboard or elsewhere.

If you have an adequate supply of air moving over the system (most
offices or homes have positive ventilation) you can generally run a
system without the cover for extended periods without a problem. (I'm
talking about completely removing the cover - not just leaving the slots
uncovered.) HOWEVER, the biggest reason you have a cover to begin with
is RF sheilding. Operating a system without the full cover may create
problems with other equipment such as your neighbor's TV or Ham radio
station - very much a no-no in the eyes of the law.

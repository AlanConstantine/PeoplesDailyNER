Hi.  Recently my svga monitor has been acting up by taking about
3 minutes to warm up.  

Previously, when I first start up my PC I can see all the 
CMOS messages (RAM test ...etc) but now I've got to wait 
for about 3min before the display shows anything and
it starts up with a bright white flash.  This only happens
when the system has been off for a long time (eg overnight).
If it was only off for a couple of hours and then turned on
again, the display works as normal like before.

Does anyone know what is causing this?  Is it a warning that
it will give up soon or just signs of aging (the system is a
386sx and its about 3 yrs old).  I've used systems at work for
years and never seen this happen to a monitor yet.

I'd really appreciated any help that you fellow netters can offer.
Thanks a lot.

Edwin

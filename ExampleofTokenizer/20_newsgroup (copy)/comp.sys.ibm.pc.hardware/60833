Recently, I have been getting a CMOS Checksum error when I first turn on my
computer.  It doesn't happen everytime I turn it on, nor can I predict when it
is going to happen.  I have an AMI BIOS and all of the setting are lost, for
example the drive types and the password options.  However, the date and time
remain correct.  If anyone knows what can be causing this, please let me know.

Thank you,
Mike

I am just about to post the results of my big computer purchase.  One
of the key points was the ability to use my American Express card.  I 
read the fine print between double warranty policies of Amex and Citibank
VISA.  Sure, both will allow you double warranty on computers, but Citibank
has a maximum claim of $250.00.  Could you imagine trying to get your
monitor or mother board fixed for $250.00?  Amex has NO limit on claims.

Remember, if you use Amex, you must either send a copy of the warranty info
to them in 30 days from purchase, or you must call them to pre-register and
then send them the paperwork within 90 days of purchase (my pre-register
pak arrived today).  Citibank VISA requires no pre-registration.

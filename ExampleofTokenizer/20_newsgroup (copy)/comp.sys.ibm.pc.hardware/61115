	Build 59 still has a number of problems--sheared fonts, for 
	instance, if you have Crystal Fonts enabled.  Some other problems--	
	"color darkening" and some others.  I don't use the drivers in 
	any mode other than 1024x768x256, so if there are bugs in the
	other modes I can't say.

	To be honest, up until now, I have only found one bug in the 
	Diamond Viper drivers, and it seems innocuous.

	That is, under Microsoft Word, select Format Border, click
	shading and take a look at the patterns.  The 5% pattern
	has been swapped with the 90%, and so on.  The whole list
	is _completely_ reversed--looks right onscreen, but take
	it to another machine (i.e., a GUP or ss24x machine) or
	print it and iy shows--badly!  

	Keep in mind that I use mainly 1024x768x65k mode, so I can't
	speak for the others, but otherwise these drivers seem pretty 
	solid.

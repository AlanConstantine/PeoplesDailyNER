N(P>Just got a 66MHz 486DX2 system, and am considering getting a fan for the
N(P>CPU. The processor when running is too hot to touch so I think this is a
N(P>fairly good idea. (long ago when I did some electronics training I read
N(P>somewhere that the regions within a chip that define junctions/gates etc
N(P>slowly diffuse over time and this increases with temperature, hence a hot
N(P>chip goes off-spec sooner)

N(P>Has anyone out there got a CPU fan??

I work for a small PC OEM. We offer both a personal and professional
system line. Our 486 pro machines always have a CPU cooling fan on DX2
and DX-50 units.

N(P>Is there more than 1 type?

There are several manufacturers.

N(P>Do you have to remove the CPU from its scoket to install the fan?

Sometimes - depends on the specific fan model.

N(P>Do all CPU fans derive their power from spare drive power lines?

All the ones I've seen do; many come with a 'Y' connector, so you don't
have to have a "spare" connector.

N(P>Anyone had any trouble with CPU fans?

None.

N(P>Does anyone have any evidence that CPU fans are a complete waste of
money?

Touch a 486DX-50 chip after its been running a few minutes - you won't
feel the fan is a waste!

N(P>How are these fans attached? (glue? clips? melted cheese?)

Depends on the model. Many use clips - make sure you use heat sink
grease, or heat transfering tape, or you will have wasted your money.

N(P>Roughly how much cooler will the CPU be with a fan as opposed to
without? (an advert I've read claims 85F vs 185F)

Tough to tell - I do know the chip sheds a lot of heat.

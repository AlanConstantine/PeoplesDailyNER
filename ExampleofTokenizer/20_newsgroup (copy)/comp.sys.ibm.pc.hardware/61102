yes

yes, seen glue-on, tape-on, clip-on, one-inch square and larger.
my favorite is the 3.5 inch plastic U.S.Toyo fan I use just plopped
down on top of the chip during open-case service.

depends on the mounting

only if the manufacturer was smart

only if it goes out - got that "blanket" effect which doesn't help chip life

longer system life makes good economic sense to me

yes - well, not the melted cheese

lets you touch the surface - the "rule of thumb" for cooling solid-state

>Any info appreciated,

the "attached" fans look slick and work well but I'm bothered by the potential
loss of cooling if the fan goes out. at least with the power supply fan you
can reach back there every few days and feel the fan blowing.

I prefer to put a stock fan off the drive brackets or front panel
to blow air across the cpu - depends a lot on case and board layout, though.

on-chip fans from Fry's Electronics in the SF Bay Area are about 30.00. I
get the stock power supply fans for about 11.00.

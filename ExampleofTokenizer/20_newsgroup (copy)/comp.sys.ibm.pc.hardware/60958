Hi,
    Can somebody tell me step by step how to add a 40Mb IDE Kalok?
HD to an existing 120Mb IDE Maxtor HD with Stacker 3.0 and DOS 5?
I know how to set the jumpers on the 40M to be slave and the settings
for heads, wpcom, sectors, etc. I also know that I have to do some
CMOS settings and fdisk. The problem is: what letter will the CMOS
give the new drive? If it's D:, what will happen when Stacker creates
D: and swap? Can I tell CMOS to make it E:? So that if I Stack it, I
will have C, D, E and F?
    I know this could be an FAQ or in a readme somewhere, but I want
to hear from somebody who've actually done it. Thanks!
							     Romy

Robert,

You have probably solved your problem by now.  Anyway, if you can get your
hands on QA Plus (version 4.21, maybe others as well), it will let you write
the COMPAQ CMOS settings.  I know because I just did it. 

I was just about to search for such a diagnostic disk when my brother-in-law 
fixed an old DESKPRO with it.  You might try the simtel mirror FTP sites.

George

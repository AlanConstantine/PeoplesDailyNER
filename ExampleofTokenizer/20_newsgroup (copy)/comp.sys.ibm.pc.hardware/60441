Summary: ** Mitsubishi MR535 Hard Drive Help!! **
Keywords: Hard Disk
Lines: 17

I have a new MR535 Mitsubishi hard drive (RLL or MFM) that has been
in storage and will not format.  I suspected that the switch settings
may have been moved in the movement of the drive from one place to
another.  Does anyone have the switch settings for this drive.  It has
J1 SW1 with 6 switches and SW2 has 8 switches.  SW2 is the one that 
selects the drive number.  If you have info on this drive, or know 
a number I can call to configure it, please, please let me know by
email.  It has 977 cyl 5 heads and I think is type 17.        

Thanks in advance!

Chuck Browning

Has anybody every come across a problem whereby a hard disk locks up (ie. crashes the system) when attempting to load disk caching?

I think the logic board may have been buggered, but the drive works PERFECTLY without a disk cache.

I tried HyperDisk and various versions of SmartDRIVE, all to no avail.

Any advice would be MUCH appreciated .. I need a cached drive, but I need the extra space of my second drive just as much! :-)

Thanks.

Cheers, Ben

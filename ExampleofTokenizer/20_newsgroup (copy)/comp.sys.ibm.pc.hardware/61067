The original poster, John Navitsky, said that he might use the monitor on
a SparcStation LX. The LX is able to generate a picture at 1280*1024 at
76 Hz. Not officially, but I tried to set this resolution and refresh rate
and the LX came up with a non-syncing screen. Our tube obviously couldn't
handle this speed. At 67 Hz, it worked perfectly.

When buying a third party monitor that's going to be used on a SparcStation
LX, you might consider a monitor that's fast enough to do 1280*1024 at 76Hz.
I don't know for sure whether the LX supports this (Sun certainly won't tell
you) so you'll have to check.

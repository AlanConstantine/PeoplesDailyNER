Hi!

   I'm busy resurrecting some old machines (hey, they're cheap and they
work :)) and would be grateful for any help with the following card -

Magitronic - full length 8 bit memory only card.
Has room for 8 rows of 256K dips for a total of 2MB RAM.
Has an 8 position dip switch on it, presumably for addressing.

Does any kind soul out there have any docs or drivers for this beast?
I'd be disgustingly grateful.

                            Thanks,
                                    Lee.

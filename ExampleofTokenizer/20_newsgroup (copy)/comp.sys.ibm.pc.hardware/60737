Hi.  I am trying to set up a Conner 3184 and a Quantum 80AT drive.  I have
the conner set to the master, and the quantum set to the slave (doesn't work
the other way around).  I am able to access both drives if I boot from a 
floppy, but the drives will not boot themselves.  I am running MSDOS 6, and
have the Conner partitioned as Primary Dos, and is formatted with system
files.  I have tried all different types of setups, and even changed IDE
controller cards.  If I boot from a floppy, everything works great (except
the booting part :)).  The system doesn't report an error message or anything,
just hangs there.  Does anyone have any suggestions, or has somebody else
run into a similar problem?  I was thinking that I might have to update the bios
on one of the drives (is this possible?).  Any suggestions/answers would be
greatly appreciated.  Please reply to:

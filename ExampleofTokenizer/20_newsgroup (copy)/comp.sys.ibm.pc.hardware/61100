Then again, maybe $2445 for the gateway system isn't too cheap.

I have a system from Micron computers:

486-2-50, 16 meg ram, 245 Maxtor HD, Local bus IDE / 2 meg video card, and
the same 15" monitor.  The system with shipping came to $2200.  I sold the
sx-33 chip that came with it and bought a dx2-50.  Total price $2300-2400.

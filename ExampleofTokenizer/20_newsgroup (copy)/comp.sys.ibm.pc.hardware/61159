I have a Headland Technologies Video Seven VRAMII board that only
came with 512K, at the time this was ok but...

I need info or help with upgrading this board to 1 Mbyte.  There are
2 rows of pins over the VRAM chips, I think for a piggyback board
of VRAM.  I would like to hear from anyone that may be able to help
me upgrade this board.  Maybe someone from Headland who maybe read-
ing this has one of these piggyback boards just laying around, please
please please!

Does anyone know of where I could maybe buy the upgrade for this?  I
would sure love to use this in 800X600-256 color mode but for the time
being, I can only get 3/4 of the screen with the bottom part a white
strip, obviously because of the missing VRAM, actually I'm surprised
it even works to this degree at all!

As a last resort, I will wind up selling this board :^( and probably be
getting a 1 Mb-ET4000 based "dumb frame buffer".  This VRAMII was Editors
Choice in the 9/24/91 PC Mag.  So if anyone has any info, please email
or as a last resort post to this group.  Thanks in advance.

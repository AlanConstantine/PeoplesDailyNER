Hello,

   I have a Diamond Stealth VRAM card (the older version
with the DIP switches on the back).  I have two problems:

1 ) I've lost the manual!!!

2 ) I have it in a machine with a network card, and
    everything works fine until I run windows, when
    the network connection dies.

    (In case it's important, the network card is an
     SMC ArcNet 8-Bit compatable card.  It's I/O
     address is 02E0 and it's RAM base address is
     D000.  It's also using IRQ 2)


    I believe there is a file on the Diamond Bboard that
explains how to sort this out, but with no manual, I don't
know the Bboard number.

    If you can, please help me with as many of the following
as possible:

a ) Send me the Diamond BBS number
b ) E-mail (or post) the DIP switch settings for the card
    (or fax them to me at (412) 521-8668)
c ) Tell me what I'm doing wrong, so I can magicly get
    everything working.

    Any help at all would be much appreciated.

                Thanks in advance,

                       Red/.

(How is 0-40 twice 1.25? Do you just pick whatever SCSI setup that makes
the statment "correct"?)
Even if you could make such a statement it would be meaningless unless
you understood that ESDI and IDE (I include SCSI and ATA) are
completely different (ESDI is device-level, like MFM/RLL).

Great, you can compare two numbers (ATA has several speed modes, by the
way) but what the article said was misleading/wrong.

I would recommend people call the NCR board and download the ANSI specs
if they are really interested in this stuff.

Something is missing there. :) Anyway, I agree. There's a lot of
opportunity for marketing jingo like "SCSI-2 compliant" which tells
you nothing about the performance, whether it has "WIDE" support, etc.

What does it use? Hopefully a good NCR chip (e.g. 53c710)

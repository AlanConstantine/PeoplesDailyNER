I'm afriad that's not true.  The monitor problem seems to occur whenever
the 15" Mag monitor is put into 1024x768 mode.  I'm running OS/2 at 1024 and
the same symptoms appear.

It does not seem like a video card problem as the Cirrus Logic 5426 chip and
the ATI GUP seem to cause these problems... two VERY  different cards.

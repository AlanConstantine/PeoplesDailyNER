I'm looking for a PC that is small and doesn't break apart if you drop
it on the groud. 
It doesn't have to have graphics, text only will do
just fine. It doesn't have to be fast either, 8086 will do, I hope.
But you must stand a pretty hard enviroment without breaking apart,
jumnping on it or trying to use it outdoor while it is raining and so
forth. I need 640Kb of memory and a convinient way of loading
applications into it that I wrote myself (floppy or somekind of
writeable cartridge?). 

Is there a PC like that?? And where can I get more info?
I know of the Atari portfolio but it can't stand the rain....

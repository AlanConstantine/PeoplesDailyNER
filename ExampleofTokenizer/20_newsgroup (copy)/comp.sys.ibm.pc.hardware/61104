The fan in my power supply, like most, is distractingly LOUD. Has anyone found 
a solution to running a pc with peace and quiet? Short of buying a notebook 
PC, I don't know what to do. Oh yeah, I did hear about a power supply called a 
"Silencer" - which is supposed to be more quiet. Has anyone had experience with
this? I was quoted a price of $225 (!) for a 270Watt Silencer.

I've even considered stuffing my PC case in one of those acoustic "printer 
enclosures", but that wouldn't be the most elegant solution. Also, I'm 
guessing that would also cut the ventilation.

Any other ideas?

Thanks in advance for ANY suggestions! Please E-mail whatever you post...

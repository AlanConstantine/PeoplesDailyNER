I've got a 386DX-40, 4MB and I'm using Windows 3.1. Sometimes I wondered why 
Windows worked endlessly on my HD when I was doing nothing (execpt having lunch
or something like that). Then I turned this virtual memory swapfile off, and
Windows became quite faster, but now having less memory free. And so I'm still
wondering, why windows is reading everything from virtual memory when the
convertional is sufficient? Any common-sense-explanation is really appreciated.

If anyone out there can help, I would greatly appreciate it.

This christmas, I built a computer out of used parts for my Father-in-law.
The disk drive that I installed was a Seagate 251-1 MFM.  Anyway, he now he
would like to put another HD into this system.  I DON'T want to buy another
MFM, the only reason why I used an MFM in the first place is that it was
FREE.  Would I need a special IDE HD controller?  Also, if I do need a 
special IDE controller, where can I purchase one, & how much are they?

Please send any responses to:

I'm having trouble with installing a second IDE drive on a Promise IDE caching
controller. The first drive is a conner 3204 and works fine. The second drive
is a conner 30174, it is currently unjumpered  to be the slave drive. The
problem is the slave drive is recognized but is reported back as having no
free space. Disabling cache has made no effect. What else should I check for?

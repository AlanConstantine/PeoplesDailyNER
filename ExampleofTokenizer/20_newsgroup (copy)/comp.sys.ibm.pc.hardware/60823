Our university is wanting to buy a couple of servers to provide Email
to students (@ 2300) and faculty (@ 250). Two servers are being
lokked at for one to provide news service and one mail service from a
proposed Internet connection. Are there any foreseable problems with
this proposed set up? Provided that IHETs is providing an Ethernet
line from a Cisco router into our network.

2 X 	486 DX 50 MHz
	SMC Elite 32 or 32TP EISA  NIC
	Dual Duplexed 2.5Gb SCSI-2  
    	with 5yr parts and labor on everything but the hard drives
	running UNIVEL UNIX for Application Servers

We will run CC:Mail on a campus wide Novell network to access these
<hopefully>. Is there any other aspect I should be looking at?



Which NIC do I use? 
Is this enough disk space?
etc...

 
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

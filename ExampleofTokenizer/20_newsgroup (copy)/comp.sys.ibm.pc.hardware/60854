.. actually from Alistair Scott
afs@tauon.ph.unimelb.edu.au

I have come across a old external hard disk and I can't find
any specs for it anywhere...

It is made by NEC (yes I tried tech support.... no help), and it
has a model number APC-H27C and is labelled "Expansion Hard Disk"

Can anyone help me out with figuring out what this beast is.
The external connector looks like a scsi plug, and the date on the 
drive chassis is 1984... os it's pretty old.

I just want to see what it is, before I deep six it or rip it 
apart for bits.



thanks

Hello All!

I recently acquired a CD-ROM drive, a Mitsumi (mfg. Feb/93)   [Hey, it
was free :-)   ]    I'm quite pleased with the performance, but it seems
to crash a lot when I use PLAYCD.EXE that came with it a DESQview 2.31 -
Thoughts?  This mainly happens when my BBS is running in the background and
I load the program up.. If I load the program, it doesn't crash, and I start
the disk, stop the program and start the BBS its OK, but otherwise I have
big problems.. (IE, they can only be solved with a cold boot).

If -anybody- can mail me to help me, I would be eternally grateful 
(unfortunately, my feed to this group is a little unreliable so I would appreciate
 if you could mail, but by all means, post it too because I'm sure somebody else 
 would like to know...)

Cheers,
Wes

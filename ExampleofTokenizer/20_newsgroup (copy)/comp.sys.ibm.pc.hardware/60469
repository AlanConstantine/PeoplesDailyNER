This past winter I found myself spending a ridiculous amout of time in front
of my computer.  Since my eyes were going berserk, I decided to shell out
some serious money to upgrade from a 14" to a 17" monitor.  I'm running
800x600 at 72 Hz.  My eyes are very grateful.  However, I find myself using
a smaller font with less eye strain.  Has anyone else had this kind of 
experience?  I thought that small fonts were the culprit but it seems that
flicker was my real problem.  Any comments?

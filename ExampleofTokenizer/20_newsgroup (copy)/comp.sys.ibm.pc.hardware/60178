Why don't you start with the spec-sheet of the ISA bus first?
You can quote SCSI specs till you're blue in the face, but if they
exceed the ISA bus capability, then what's the point?

Who says IDE is limited to 5 megs/sec?  What about VLB-IDE?  Does anyone
know how they perform?

As implimented on what system?

Given the original question (SCSI used only as a single hard drive
controller),  is it then necessary to get a SCSI drive that will do
at least 5, maybe 10 megs/sec for the SCSI choice to make any sence?
What does a 200-400 meg 5 megs/sec SCSI drive cost?

The original CGA cart back in '84 was $300.  I think the original EGA card
(or PGA?) was $800.  SCSI has stood relatively alone in not coming down
in price, mainly because we're talking about PC's and not Sun's or Sparc
or SGI or (name your favorite unix workstation).  That is, after millions
of PC buying decisions over the years, SCSI has had plenty of time to
come down in price.

I won't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good, well implimented
data highway, but I still want to know why it intrinsically better
(than IDE, on an ISA bus) when it comes to multi-tasking OS's when
managing data from a single SCSI hard drive.

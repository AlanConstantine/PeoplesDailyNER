The subject says it all. I'm wondering if anyone on the net has
had any experiences with Cornell Computer Systems of California.
I was checking out their ad in Computer Shopper, and they seem to
have a good balance between service, price, and hardware. The question
is -- are they reliable?

E-mail responses would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Adam.

I have had a Gateway Telepath modem for about a month or so now.
Actually, I had one that wouldn't connect to ANYTHING no matter
what software I used, so I got a new one sent to me.  This allows
me to connect to my favorite News system with ZERO problems.  So
I'm somewhat happier ....

But I still cannot connect to my favorite DOS bbs with any kind
of reliability.  I have success about 1/10 calls.  Not good!  I
would hope that the fact that this one can connect to at least
ONE of my fave places means I just need to adjust it.

What I usually get is a fast stream of garbage, in the modem response
line on the dial window. Sometimes it will drop to full screen mode
first, then I get about 2-3 screens of garbage.  In both cases the
modem seems to time out before connecting and drops carrier.

I am using DEFAULT settings (AT&F) and getting this problem.  I
am using the AUTOCONFIGURE settings that Gateway has supplied with
my copy of Qmodem (ATW1&C1&D2S95=44&W0) and getting this problem.
(They have refused to help me beyond this, claiming "it must be
the BBS" or something like that.  Not so -- my work modem connects
to this same place just fine, using factory settings -- a Microcom.)

Anyone have any ideas?!

Hi!
	I recently purchased the Toshiba 3401 CDROM.  I own an Adaptec 1542B
SCSI card, and I have so far failed to get the CDROM to work under DOS.  It
works very well under OS/2, so I know that the drive is not faulty.
In my config.sys, I have aspi3dos.sys, aspidisk.sys, aspicd.sys.  In my 
autoexec.bat, I have MSCDEX, which came with DOS 6.0.  MSCDEX seems to find
and install the drive as drive F:, but when I switch to that drive and try a
dir, I get an error message telling me the drive is not ready or something
like that.  The CDROM is locked too, and the adaptec utilities don't seem to
recognize that I have a CDROM at that point.
	Has anyone ever had this problem?  Is there something abvious that I
am missing?  And finally, I was wondering if anyone using this setup could 
kindly post his/her config.sys and autoexec.bat.

	Thank you very much!

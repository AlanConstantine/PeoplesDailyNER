I read sometime in the last couple of weeks, an article which desribed how to play PC sound
through a soundblaster. I didn't save the article and all old articles have been purged from
our system here. 

Would whomever posted the article detailing where to connect the wires please re-post?

Specifically, I need to know where to connect wires from the PC speaker to the SB card.

Thx in Advance, Carl

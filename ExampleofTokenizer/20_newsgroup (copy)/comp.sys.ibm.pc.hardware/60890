I was having major memory problems a few monthes ago.
getting parity error - system halted error message in windows.
I ran QA/PLUS, Check It, Diagnose, as well as several shareware
memory checkers. I had a total of 8 meg SIMM in my system.
these store bought/ shareware memory diagnostics either ran fine
without errors or found an error at some address that I couldn't
place on a memory chip. Out of exahperation I came up with
the (now deleted) steps to find bad memory chips. I found 2
(moral : never buy memory stamped "not for sensitive or critical 
applications" on the back.
        anyway I did filter out all the bad memory chips using 
combinations of 4 of the 8 meg chips and creating a RAM drive to
test on. Although it dodn't alleviate my parity error problems
in windows. I did manage to find bad memory chips in this manner
It has NEVER failed to find a bad chip for me. and the commercial/
shareware have always faild me either not finding the error or
pointing to an addreww which I have no idea on what chip it is.

p.s. man my typing stinks today and I don't feel like futzing around with 
this line editor.

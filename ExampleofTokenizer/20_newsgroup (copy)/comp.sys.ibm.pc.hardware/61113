My 3.5" floppy drive stopped recognizing low density (720K) floppies.

The controller and drive works fine in another system. I was told it
could be the DMA chip. The system is a 386DX-25 using Chips & Technology
chip set. I'm open to all suggestions. Please send your replies to:

Thanks In Advance!!!

I recently bought a monichrome VGA monitor for $99 that will do
1024x768 non-interlaced, which seems like a good deal. However, it is
a fixed-scan rate monitor, and only handles 52 kHz horizontal, I
think. With my Trident card it works only in graphics modes 5e and 62
- not much use, since just about any application will set the mode to
something else, especially if it wants to do text, I suppose. Anyway:

 - is there any way that I can use this as a general-purpose VGA
   display with a 1-meg trident 8900C card?

 - if not, can I do so with some sort of different VGA card?

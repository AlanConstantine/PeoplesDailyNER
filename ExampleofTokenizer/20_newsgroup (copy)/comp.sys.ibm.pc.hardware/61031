I've noticed a recent proliferation of 1 gig SCSI-2 3.5" drives, in
particular, the Fujitsu 2694 and the Micropolis 2112. There is also the
Maxtor LXT1240s (6100 rpm, 1.2 gig) drive. They are all quite cheap,
and have nice 3-5 year warranties. 

My questions are: Is there a catch?
                  Which one is better?
                  What type of SCSI-2 do these drives use?
                  Is the service generally better for one of these     
         
                  manufacturers?
                  Are prices likely to go down soon for any reason?

thanks,

Michael Taylor

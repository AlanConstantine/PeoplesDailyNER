	I need to be able to cause a beep, but without using any interrupt
routines, as I cannot use the BIOS. I believe that the PIC might have
something to do with it, but I'm having troubles deciphering the
information I have on it to figure out how to program it!

	I'm programming all of this in Turbo C, if that makes any
diference at all...

	Please can anyone help me??!

Thanks,
	
	Nicola

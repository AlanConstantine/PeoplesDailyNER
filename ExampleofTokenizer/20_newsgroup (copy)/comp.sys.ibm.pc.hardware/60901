[REMAINDER DELETED]

I don't have my copy of the manual with me right now, but I can offer the
following in the interim:

   1)  The card uses port addresses 0x2E0 and 0x2E8 (which are NOT
       configurable).  These addresses, incidentally, were inadvertantly
       omitted from my version of the manual.

   2)  I believe there is a dip that controls whether or not to enable
       IRQ 2 (for CGA or EGA support??!?).

               Yes, that IS a '%' (percent sign) in my network address.

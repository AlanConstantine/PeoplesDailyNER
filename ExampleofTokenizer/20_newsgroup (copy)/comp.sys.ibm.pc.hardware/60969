I am looking at getting a laptop for work and I was trying to decide
between the Toshibas and Gateway's Nomad.  The price is about the same, 
but the Gateway has significantly better performance (200MB vs. 120MB 
hard drive, 50Mhz 486DX2 vs.  25Mhz 486SL) and much cheaper accessories 
(extra batteries, modem...)

The concern I have about Gateway is the durability and reliability.
Does anyone out there have any experience with the Gateway Nomad?

Thanks,

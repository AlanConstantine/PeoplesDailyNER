I bought a 386DX33 system a little over 2 years ago, and was satisfied with
everything about Zeos.  That computer went off to grad school with my son and
I replaced it with a 486DX2/66 pkg 4 (345 MBHD, 16MB ram) with Diamond Viper,
128K level 2 cache, and tower upgrades, delete the CTX monitor.  I got a
17" HP D1193A monitor employee purchase.  This is a *great* system, fast,
quiet, solidly built, not a single glitch bringing it up.  Tech support seems 
busier now than 2 years ago.  I called with a configuration question, and
they called back 4 hours later with the right answer.  I think there's a
slight premium over Gateway prices, but IMHO Zeos is worth it. BTW they 
have enough 800 lines that I've never gotten a busy signal calling sales,
customer service, or tech support. Now, you usually wait 5 or 10 minutes to
talk to someone, but at least you get in the queue and wait on their dime.

An index of all files in the WSMR-SIMTEL20.Army.Mil MS-DOS collection
is available in two formats:

Directory PD1:<MSDOS.FILEDOCS>
 Filename   Type  Description
==============================================
SIMIBM.ZIP    B   Comma-delim list of all MSDOS files w/descrip.
SIMLIST.ZIP   B   Text format list of all MSDOS files w/descrip.

These files are updated every 7-10 days.  See AAAREAD.ME in that
directory for details. 

SIMTEL20 allows only nine ANONYMOUS FTP logins during weekday
prime time, 5am to 3pm Mountain Time (GMT-7), but 27 otherwise.

SIMTEL20 files are also available by anonymous ftp from mirror sites
OAK.Oakland.Edu (141.210.10.117), wuarchive.wustl.edu (128.252.135.4),
archive.orst.edu (128.193.2.13), ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9), nic.funet.fi
(128.214.6.100), src.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.3.7), nic.switch.ch
(130.59.1.40), archie.au (139.130.4.6), NCTUCCCA.edu.tw (140.111.3.21),
by e-mail through the BITNET/EARN file servers, or by uucp from UUNET's
1-900-GOT-SRCS.  See UUNET file uunet!~/info/archive-help for details.

OAK.Oakland.Edu is the primary mirror site for WSMR-SIMTEL20.Army.Mil.
All other mirrors (except wuarchive) and all LISTSERV and TRICKLE
servers get their SIMTEL20 files from OAK instead of SIMTEL20 because
it is much faster and allows more simultaneous ftp connections.  OAK is
always "in sync" with SIMTEL20 because I maintain it, in addition to my
duties at SIMTEL20.  I run OAK's mirror program whenever new files are
added at SIMTEL20.

MSDOS-Ann@TACOM-EMH1.Army.Mil is a ONE-WAY (moderated) mailing list
which is used by the Internet MS-DOS archive managers to announce new
additions to their collections. 

The announcements posted to this mailing list are also posted to Usenet
newsgroup comp.archives.msdos.announce.  If your host has Usenet News
please do not subscribe to MSDOS-Ann.

To add yourself to the mailing list send e-mail to
listserv@TACOM-EMH1.Army.Mil with this command in the
body of the message:

    subscribe msdos-ann

To subscribe something other than the account the mail is coming from,
such as a local redistribution list, then add that address to the
"subscribe" command; for example, to subscribe "local-msdos-ann":

    subscribe local-msdos-ann@your.domain.net msdos-ann

Please do not include a signature because it may confuse the server.
Send mail with the word  help  in the body of the message to get a
complete list of commands and their syntax.

If you later change your mind and wish to unsubscribe, send e-mail
from the same address where you were when you subscribed.  Send to
listserv@TACOM-EMH1.Army.Mil with this command in the body of the
message:

unsubscribe msdos-ann

This server is only for mailing lists and information files.  It will

I was just reading in PC Magazine that the peripherals in a PC with an
ISA bus can only access 16MB of memory.  Also, that some video cards on
the ISA bus look for a memory aperture to map their memory to.  So that
if I wanted to put 16MB of memory on my PC, my video card wouldn't have
anywhere to map it's memory to.

Can someone explain this in more detail.  Is there a way around this
limit.

If you email me a response, I will summarize.

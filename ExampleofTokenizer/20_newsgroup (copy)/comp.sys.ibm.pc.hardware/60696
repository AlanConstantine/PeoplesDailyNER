I believe that any VL/EISA/ISA motherboard that uses the HINT chipset
is limited to 24-bit EISA DMA (where 'real' EISA DMA is 32-bit).  The
HINT EISA DMA has the 16 mb ram addressing limitation of ISA.  For this
reason I would pass.  I own one of these (HAWK VL/EISA/ISA) and am look-
ing to replace it for exactly this reason.

Please double-check me on this.  In other words, call the motherboard
manufacturer and ask them if the motherboard supports true 32-bit EISA
DMA.

Other than this limitation, the motherboard works quite well (I am using
mine with DOS 5, Windows 3.1, and UNIX S5R3.2).  Also with Adaptec 1742a
EISA SCSI host adapter.

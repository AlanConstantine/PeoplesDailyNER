I ran a 386-33 out of a cardboard box for more than a year with no
major effects (yeah, no case at all, MB sitting on a static bag)
other than the noise from the Poersupply it ran pretty good.
as for cooling problems I bought a 12-14 inch fan and  turned
it on full and set the output directly on the motherboard.

I did finally get a case though and I am still running the parts
with no ill effects.

I also had no kids to spill things on the MB> I had no cat leaving
hair on the MB etc. etc. on and on....

the two major concerns are keeping static away and keeping the MB cool
enjoy

hi folks
i have 2 hd first is an seagate 130mb
the second a cdc 340mb (with a future domain no ram)
i'd like to change my 2 controller ide & scsi and buy
a new one with ram (at least 1mb) that could controll 
all of them
any companies?
how many $?
and is it possible via hw or via sw select how divide
the ram cache for 2 hd? (for example using dos that is 
about all on one hd i'd like to reserve ram cache just to it)

thanks to all

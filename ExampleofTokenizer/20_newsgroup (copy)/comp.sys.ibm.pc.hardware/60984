Maybe I should have been clearer.  I have a Intel 386DX/25 that I would
like to use to put together a system however all the motherboards that
the local vendors are now selling are running either at 33 or 40 MHz.  I
guess I can cross my fingers and hope the CPU runs at that speed. ;^)

I think I'll take Mark's advice and see if any of the boards have
a socketed oscillator and head down to the local electronics store...

Thanks for the info...

=B^)

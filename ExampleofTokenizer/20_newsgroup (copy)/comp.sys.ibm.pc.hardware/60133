I'm posting this for a friend that runs a BBS. I'm not sure if its under
DOS or Windows.

He is interested in a board that has 16 ports on it. In another post,
someone suggeted a DigiBoard, but didn't have too much info on it.

Could someone give me information on any boards that they know of with
the before mentioned configuration. Models. Specifications. Prices.
 Manufacturers.

Thanks,

Rob

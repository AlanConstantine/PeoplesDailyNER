Does anybody have an opinion on the Philips 1762DT 17" monitor?  How does it
compare to the Nanao 17"?  I am looking for a good 17" (like many other
net'ers) and found a good price for the Philips.  Here some the specs:

	Sony Trinitron tube
	digital micro control
	1280x1024 NI
	.25 dp
	300x225 mm display area
	to 100 Hz refresh
	anti-glare, MPR-II...
	auto-scan 30-64 kHz

Why don't I ever see this monitor for sale (ONE company in Apr computer shopper)
What is the 1764DC?  What is the best price around for this?....

and how 'bout that MAG 17"?  I love my MAG 15" (except for that little color
alignment thing on the l/r edges)...

I have a Gateway 2K 486DX/33 system with the ATI Ultrapro video card (identical to the system mentioned in the original posting, except 33MHz instead of 66).  For some reason, the system refuses to recognize COM4.  For example, if I configure the on-board (motherboard) COM ports for COM1/COM2, everything is fine; if I configure them for COM3/COM4, COM3 works OK, but COM4 is not recoznized.

I ran into this about six months ago.  My system is a GW2000 486DX/66V,
8 megs RAM, 1Meg ATI GUP VLB. It seems the problem is that the ATI
Graphics Ultra Pro card consumes the COM4 port for some reason, so only
COM1-3 are available.  I believe this is documented somewhere in the
system manuals, but I can't recall where.

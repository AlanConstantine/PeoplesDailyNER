IBM, Apple, Motorola Ready to Unwrap PowerPC 601 Processor


The wraps will come off the PowerPC 601 processor this week, as Motorola
Corp., IBM, and Apple Computer Inc. detail the results of their yearlong
effort. This first in a series of PowerPC processors will be a 32-bit
processor with a 64-bit memory interface, much like Intel Corp.'s
Pentium, with the capability of performing as many as three instructions
per clock cycle, according to sources familiar with the chip. Motorola
is expected to release the chip in volume by year end in two
configurations, running at 50 and 66 MHz with performance of 40 and 50
SPECint89 marks, respectively, sources said. Floating-point performance
for the 3.6-volt processors will be even better, as their SPECfp89
performance will be 60 and 80, respectively. The 601, a scaled-down
version of the Power 220 chip developed by IBM for its RS/6000
workstations, will also include a 32K single buffered cache on the chip
with protocols to support Motorola's 64-bit multiprocessor 88110 bus
built in. The chip, which is being designed initially to support the
Micro Channel Architecture, is bus independent, so vendors could develop
PowerPC- based systems using a number of different architectures,
including ISA, EISA, or Sun Microsystems Inc.'s S-bus design, one source
noted.

According to sources familiar with the development effort, Motorola has
been extremely successful in developing the PowerPC as an inexpensive
architecture, despite a complex design made up of more than 2.8 million
transistors using a 0.6-micron technology. Initial chips are expected to
be priced from $300 to $400 -- only slightly higher than Intel Corp.'s
486 processors -- but could be sold profitably for less than $100, one
source said.

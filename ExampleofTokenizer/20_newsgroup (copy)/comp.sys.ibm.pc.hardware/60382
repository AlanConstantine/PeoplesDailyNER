The only things you'll be able to salvage from the junior are the floppy drives
and monitor.  The floppies are 360k, and the monitor is CGA, but you will need
an adaptor cable to use it.  The junior does not use standard cards.  Unless 
you're really strapped for cash, you should just junk the thing and buy new 
stuff.

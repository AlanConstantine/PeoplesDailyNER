Is it possible to buy a serial I/O card with the 16550 UART's built in
(rather than having to buy them separately, and socketing them in)?

My current I/O card uses 8250's (correct number? The braindead ones anyway).
It also controls two floppy drives, and two IDE hard drives.

Ideally, I'd like to get a new multi I/O card, that had 2 serial ports with
16550's and could also control another 2 IDE HD's. It would have to have
configurable addresses for both the serial ports, and the IDE controller, so
it could co-exist with my existing card.

Does such a beast exist? Now the hard part - where can I get one in Australia,
preferably Brisbane?

Thanks,

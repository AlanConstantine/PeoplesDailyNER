AHHHUUURRRRGGGGHHHH!!!!!   Spinrite says: 80 sectors marked bad in the FAT
initially, 79 returned to active use, 80 new sectors marked bad, following
successive runs of spinrite.

I think I need a new ESDI HDD controller.

I know that these two will work:
DTC 6280
Adaptec 2322B

Others that MIGHT work:
DTC 6282
Ultra Store 12
WD 1007V

If you own one and will sell it cheaply I'll buy it.

Thanks,

-Greg Bishop

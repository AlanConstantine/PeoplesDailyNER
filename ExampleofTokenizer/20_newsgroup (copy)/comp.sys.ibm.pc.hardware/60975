I posted almost the same bad experience with  Midwest Micro but our
%^*^&*^&* news program only sent one paragraph out of the middle. In
addition to the facts that:
(a) the modems (I had ordered two) wouldn't work as documented
and
(b) the tech person had NO CLUE as to how it should work,
it also turned out that:
(c) one of the two modems they sent was clearly USED but the techs
thought that was standard practice and
(d) the modems made all three of my floppy drives quit working and
my CMS250 tape drive start running away.

That they are incompetent is one thing, but that they sell used stuff
as new and won't even apologize for it is another. Stay away from
these crooks!

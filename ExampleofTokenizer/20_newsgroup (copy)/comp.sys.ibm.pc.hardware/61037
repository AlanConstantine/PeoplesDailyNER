I have recently picked up a page scanner by the name of EZ-SCAN II
model 35.  The software for it was made for per-Windows 3.x windows
and will not work with the newwer windows.  Does any one out there kow
were I could find the company that made this beast (Copyrights say
1987.) And the name GMS a division of DEST.  Does anyone know if these
companies still exist and if they do, do they have an email address?

Or, if anyone knows of a freeware/shareware programme that is able to
access this scanner.

Thanks in advance, and please email - this group scrolls way too
quickly.

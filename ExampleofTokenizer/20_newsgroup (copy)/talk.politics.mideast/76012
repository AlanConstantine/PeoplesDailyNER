I was convinced that no one could have a more warped sense of the
world. They were 'our' grandparents who were cold-bloodedly exterminated
by the Armenians between 1914 and 1920, not yours. And you can always
participate in 'The Turkish Genocide Day' along with millions of Turkish 
and Kurdish people on April 23, 1993 in the United States and Canada. 

...On this occasion, we once again reiterate the unquestioned 
justice of the restitution of Turkish and Kurdish rights and...

- We demand that the x-Soviet Armenian Government admit its 
responsibility for the Turkish and Kurdish Genocide, render 
reparations to the Muslim people, and return the land to its 
rightful owners. The recognition of the Genocide has become an 
issue which cannot be delayed further, and it is imperative that 
artificial obstacles created for political manipulations be removed.

- We believe the time has come to demand from the the United States 
that it formally recognizes the Turkish and Kurdish Genocide, adopts 
the principles of our demands and refuses to accede to Armenian pressures 
to the contrary.

- As taxpayers of the United States, we express our vehement 
protest to the present U.S. Government policy of continued 
coddling, protection and unqualified assistance towards x-Soviet
Armenia.

- We also demand that the United States return to the policies 
advocated by U.S. Ambassador Bristol and other enlightened statesmen,
who have undertaken a just, human and benevolent attitude towards 
the rights of the Muslim people and the just resolution of their Case.

- Our territorial demands are strictly aimed at x-Soviet Armenia's.


And in article <2BAC262D.25249@news.service.uci.edu>, you have blatantly
lied:

Well, still anxiously awaiting...

CIS Commander Pulls Troops Out of Karabagh :

"Elif Kaban, a Reuter correspondent in Agdam, reported that after a battle 
 on Wednesday, Azeris were burying scores of people who died when Armenians 
 overran the town of Khojaly, the second-biggest Azeri settlement in the 
 area. 'The world is turning its back on what's happening here. We are dying 
 and you are just watching,' one mourner shouted at a group of journalists."

Armenian Soldiers Massacre Hundreds of Fleeing Families:

"The attackers killed most of the soldiers and volunteers defending the 
 women and children.  They then turned their guns on the terrified refugees.  
 The few survivors later described what happened: 'That's when the real 
 slaughter began,' said Azer Hajiev, one of the three soldiers to survive.  
 'The Armenians just shot and shot. And they came in and started carving 
 up people with their bayonets and knives.'  A 45-year-old man who had been 
 shot in the back  said:' We were walking through the brush. Then they opened 
 up on us and people were falling all around.  My wife fell, then my child."

Armenian Raid Leaves Azeris Dead or Fleeing:

"...about 1,000 of Khojaly's 10,000 people were killed in Tuesdays attack. 
 Azerbaijani television showed truckloads of corpses being evacuated from 
 the Khocaly area."

 The Washington Times, 3/2/92

Atrocity Reports Horrify Azerbaijan :

"Azeri officials who returned from the seen to this town about nine miles 
 away brought back three dead children, the backs of their heads blown off...
 'Women and children had been scalped,' said Assad Faradzev, an aide to 
 Karabagh's Azeri governor.  Azeri television showed pictures of one 
 truckload of bodies brought to the Azeri town of Agdam, some with their 
 faces apparently scratched with knives or their eyes gouged out."

Massacre By Armenians Being Reported:

"The Republic of Armenia reiterated denials that its militants had 
 killed 1,000 [Azeris]... But dozens of bodies scattered over the 
 area lent credence to Azerbaijani reports of a massacre."
 (Reuters)
 The New York Times, 3/3/92

Killings Rife in Nagorno-Karabagh, Moldova:

"Journalists in the area reported seeing dozens of corpses, including some 
 of the civilians, and Azerbaijani officials said Armenians began shooting 
 at them when they sought to recover the bodies."
 Fred Hiatt
 The Washington Post, 3/3/92

Bodies Mark Site of Karabagh Massacre:

"A local truce was enforced to allow the Azerbaijanis to collect their dead 
 and any refugees still hiding in the hills and forest.  All are the bodies 
 of ordinary people, dressed in the poor, ugly clorhing of workers. Of the 31 
 we saw only one policeman and two apparent national volunteers were wearing 
 uniform.  All the rest were civilians, including eight women and three small
 children. Two groups, apparently families, had fallen together, the children 
 cradled in the women's arms.  Several of them, including one small girl, had 
 terrible head injuries: only her face was left. Survivors have told how they 
 saw Armenians shooting them point blank as they lay on the ground."

Karabagh Survivors Flee to Mountains:

"Geyush Gassanov, the deputy mayor of Khocaly, said that Armenian troops 
 surrounded the town after 7 pm on Tuesday. They were accompanied by six 
 or seven light tanks and armoured carriers.  'We thought they would just 
 bombard the village, as they had in the past, and then retreat.  But they 
 attacked, and our defence force couldn't do anything against their tanks.'  
 Other survivors described how they had been fired on repeatedly on their 
 way through the mountains to safety. 'For two days we crawled most of the 
 way to avoid gunfire,' Sukru Aslanov said.  His daughter was killed in the 
 battle for Khodjaly, and his brother and son died on the road."

 The Times (London), 3/3/92

Corpses Litter Hills in Karabagh:

"As we swooped low over the snow covered hills of Nagorno-Karabagh we saw 
 the scattered corpses. Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as 
 they ran...Suddenly there was a thump...[our Azerbaijani helicopter] had 
 been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post..."
 Anatol Lieven
 The Times (London), 3/4/92

"Police in western Azerbaijan said they had recovered the bodies of 
 120 Azerbaijanis killed as they fled an Armenian assault in the 
 disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabagh and said they were blocked from 
 recovering more bodies."
 The Wall Street Journal, 3/4/92

Exiting Troops Attacked in Nagorno-Karabagh:

"Withdrawal halted;  Armenians Blamed...
 More video footage and reports from Khocaly paint a grim picture of 
 widespread civilian deaths and mutilation...
 One woman's feet appeared to have been bound..."

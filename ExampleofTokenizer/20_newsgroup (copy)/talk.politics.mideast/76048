Well, Napoleon. It is your kind of people who are preventing peace 
on the world. First of all, you didn't answer the question I asked
at the end of my posting. And then you told me some bullshit
throughout your posting which had no positive point about the issue,
filled with hatred, and filled with emotions. Why am I doing this?
Forget it, I don't think you are worth it to discuss the issue.

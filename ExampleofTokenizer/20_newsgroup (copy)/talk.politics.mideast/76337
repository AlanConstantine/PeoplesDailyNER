	Ok, I'll admit it.  I can't find a quote with my meager online
resources.  but i did find this little gem:

	``When the Arabs set off their volcano, there will only be Arabs in
	this part of the world.  Our people will continue to fuel the torch
	of the revolution with rivers of blood until the whole of the
	occupied homeland is liberated...''
	--- Yasser Arafat, AP, 3/12/79

	So, Ahmed is right.  There was nothing about driving Jews into
the sea, just a bit of "ethnic cleansing," and a river of blood.

	Is this an improvement?

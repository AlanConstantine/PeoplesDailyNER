 	WASHINGTON (UPI) -- Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Tuesday
 there are better ideas to stop the human slaughter in the Balkans than
 ordering American fighters to bomb the Serbs, but a frustrated senator
 told him to do just that.
 	``We've not done a damn thing,'' Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., told
 Christopher at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
 ``Preventive diplomacy is not in your capability right now in Bosnia-
 Herzegovina.
 	Biden chastised the administration and its Republican predecessor for
 what he characterized as a limp response to the Serbian policy of 
 ``ethnic cleansing'' of Muslims, including rape and shelling of
 civilians.
 	``The time has come for us and the world to stop bemoaning the fact
 that all the options are bad ones,'' Biden said. ``They are all bad ones
 and we ought to pick a couple.''
 	Biden also endorsed lifting an international arms embargo against the
 former Yugoslavia so the Muslim-dominated Bosnian government might have
 a chance to at least defend itself against the Serbs.
 	Christopher said this could give an opening role in the conflict to
                     ****************************************************
 the radical Islamic government of Iran.

O, I C!
   Biden endorsed bombing Serbian heavy weapons around the besieged
  eastern town of Srebrenica.
  	``There's not a military person...who will not tell you that they
  could today, if you gave them the order, take out the heavy weaponry
  around Srebrenica,'' Biden said.
  	``If you did nothing else, nothing else but that, you would have
  saved hundreds of women and children who are being absolutely massacred
  right now.''
  	Military action ``is the only thing that's going to change the
  equation,'' Biden said.

  	Despite the frustrations and pressure, Christopher had no enthusiasm
  for American combat aircraft to strike Serb positions in Bosnia-
  Herzegovina.

Humanitarian as in feeding them and let them get raped and killed.

Why don't they get the hell out of there, they ared doing nothing to
protect the victims anyway.. Maybe becasue they have a different agenda.

Now that they made sure the Bosnian (who were the only real subject of the
embargo last year, as everybody knows that the Serbs had an unlimited supply
of arms) wre massacred without having a chance to defend themselves, Now this
evil coldhearted snake is saying "it is too late to save them, so let them die.

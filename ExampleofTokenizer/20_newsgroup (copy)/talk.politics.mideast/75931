	The IAEA has two conflicting goals.  One is to promote the
spread of nuclear energy, the other to police its use.  Any successful
policing, ie, finding cheaters, shows that its other arm is being
overzealous in its promotion of nuclear energy.

	The IAEA announces in advance which sites it will visit.  It
allows the country it is inspecting to veto areas on the list, by
claiming they are not used for nuclear work.  Its inspectors are drawn
from all over the world, and few have any experience in bomb building.
Such experience would make the job of determining if a site was being
used for military purposes much easier.

	Unfortunately, many countries object to knowledgeable
inspectors, because the only really knowledgeable inspectors come from
about 10 countries.

	There was an excelent article on the Feb 1 1993 New Yorker on
why the IAEA fails to do its job.

Of all the stupid postings you've brought here recently, it is
illuminating that you chose to put your own name on perhaps the
stupidest of them.

Does this mean that you are calling for the dismantling of the Arab
states? 

>2.      In the event of a conflict between basic human rights and
>rights of collectivities, basic human rights should prevail.

Apparently, your answer is yes.

>6.      Attempts to solve the Israeli-Arab conflict by traditional

Attempts to solve these problem by traditional military means and
non-traditional terrorist means has also failed.  But that won't stop
them from trying again.  After all, it IS a Holy War, you know.... 

>7.      As long as the conflict is perceived as that between two

"No just solution possible."  How very encouraging.

>Having stated my assumptions, I will now state my proposal.

You mean that it gets even funnier?

No, the Fund should be financed by the Center for Policy Research.  It
IS a major organization, isn't it?  Isn't it?

Yeah, just like marriages among Arabs has strengthened their
societies.

The world could do with a bit less Middle Eastern "grace".

Boy, you're a one-man band.  Listen, if you'd like to Followup on your
own postings and debate with yourself, just tell us and we'll leave
you alone.

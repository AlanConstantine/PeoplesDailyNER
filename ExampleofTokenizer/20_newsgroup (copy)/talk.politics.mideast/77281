this last statement is not true.  According to the CBO the United States
has a force of about 88,000 US Army personel in Europe, I do not know
if this includes a USMC division in Norway.  They have available
a little more than 500 USAF attack aircraft, including various models
of the F-111, A-10, F-19A/B,  and a few F-4s. {there are about 1,000
more of these available, SAFELY TUCKED AWAY AT HOME. At one time, the
US maintained 1500 MBTs {about half were M1A1} but some of these were
relocated to the Persian Gulf.  I know the US has at LEAST one 
aircraft carrier battle group nearby and probably a marine assault
brigade.  Does anyone know if there are any B-52/B-1Bs in England?

The point is, although there are no US ground troops in Bosnia,
it is not true that that all the american forces are safely camped
outside of St. Louis.    

I also understand that the administration is planning to position
troops in Macedonia.  Any reaction out there to this?

Question:  day before yesterday I heard that Serbia & Montenegro
had imposed additional trade sanctions against the Bosnian Serb Rebels.
This morning a NPR reported at a bridge on the Drina (sp?) verified
that only a bread truck was allowed to pass through to Bosnia.
A Serbian {who happened to be muslim}, stated that just a few months
ago no vehicle even slowed for the boarder station. Now everyone
is stopped and searched, many are turned back.  Of course all I
heard was a translators version, I do not speak Serbo-Croatian.

If this is a effort on the part of Serbia & Montenegro {for whatever reason}
to push the Boserbs into accepting the V-O, is this not a good thing?

Peace,

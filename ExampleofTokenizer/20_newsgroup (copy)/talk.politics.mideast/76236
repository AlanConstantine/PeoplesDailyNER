I have read -just today- two articles dripping of hate and offence to
a great deal of people. I could  find as much matching hatred in your
articles as I have found in some of the self-righteous "Kill-in-the-name
of God" people.

I don't know why you are so attcaking to everyone, is it a reaction to
the hatred calls on this newsgroup, or is it a reaction to hardships
you have seen and experienced from before...
I have learnt not to judge people by only what they say, but rather
try to put myself in their place and aspire to understand their
feelings.

I hope you would be able to do the same with everyone, starting by your
ownself, because only through that you could be able to understand your
feelings and act in a the manner you would aspire everyone to adopt.

Thanks for your time

NABIL

At this time the PLO did not exist and would not for the next 20 years.
You knew that didn't you? Perhaps you might want to add up all the Jewish
civilians killed during the 48 War. I'll opt for the massacre at Deir Yassin.
Which do you think is the greater?

While we are talking about this man I have included more of his testimony
that Harry naturally does not use nor does Myths and Facts. I wonder why.
No doubt he was lying right Harry?

                "The reason was mainly economic. That is
                 to capture booty in order to maintain
                 the bases which we had then established
                 with very poor resources. The main idea,
                 despite this, remained the conquest of
                 the village by force of arms, something
                 which was then unknown in the country,
                 and became a turning point in Jewish
                 military operations"

                 Yehuda Lapidot, Jabontinsky Archives Testimony

                 "Apart from the military discussion, the
                  Lehi put forward a proposal to liqui-
                  date the residents of the village after
                  the conquest, in order to show the Arabs
                  what happens when the IZL and the Lehi
                  set out together on an operation, and for
                  another main reason - it would cause a
                  great uproar throughout the land and
                  would be an important turning point in
                  the course of the battles. The clear aim
                  was to break the Arab morale and raise
                  somewhat the morale of the Jewish commu-
                  nity in Jerusalem, which had been hit
                  hard time after time, especially recenctly
                  by the desecration of Jewish bodies which
                  fell into Arab hands"

                  Yehuda Lapidot, Jabotinsky Archives
                  testimony as quoted by Yisrael Segal in
                  "The Deir Yassin File", published by
                  Koteret Rashit 19th January 1983

So it wasn't like the Holocaust more like Lidice - a warning, a punishment.
Collective and inflicted on unarmed innocents just not as through.

                 "When it comes to prisoners, old people
                  and children, there were differences
                  of opinion, but the majority was for
                  liquidation of all the men in the village
                  and any other force that opposed us,
                  whether it be old people, women or children

                  Benzion Cohen
                  Commander of the attack on Deir Yassin,
                  (J.A.T.)

Let me put in some words here
                a. premeditated
                b. murder
What do you say about the eyewitness testimony of the man in command?

                 "We had prisoners and before the retreat
                  we decided to liquidate them. We also
                  liquidated the wounded, as anyway we could
                  not give them first aid. In one place
                  about eighty Arab prisoners were killed
                  after some of them had opened fire and
                  killed one of the people who came to give
                  them first aid. Arabs who dressed up
                  as Arab women were also found, and so
                  they started to shoot the women also who
                  did not hurry to the area where the
                  prisoners were concentrated"

                  (J.A.T.)

Shooting prisoners, the wounded, as a warning to hurry? Sounds VERY
familiar to me, how about you? Heard of other people other places doing
these things?

                 "In one case - the Zahran family - only
                  one out of twenty five survived. In
                  another house they caught the sixteen
                  year old son Fuad. His mother was holding
                  him. They killed him with a knife. The
                  mother spent twenty years after that in
                  a mental hospital. A young woman and her
                  two year old baby were shot in the
                  street. Their bodies were left there.
                  They moved to the centre of the village
                  and started to kill everybody they saw or
                  heard, as soon as anybody opened his
                  door. They were using bombs [grenades],
                  machine-guns, submachine-guns. My cousin
                  escaped with bullet-holes in his clothes.
                  One of the officers put his machinegun
                  through a window and started shooting
                  outwards, killing everybody who moved.
                  They killed my uncle, Ali Hassan Zeidan,
                  and my aunt Fatima. She heard him call
                  'help me'. She ran to him and they killed
                  her. Another neighbour Haj Yarah,
                  heard some voices and came out. They killed
                  him too. His son Muhammad, who was
                  about seventeen, heard his father call
                  him and went to the same place. They
                  killed him. His mother heard her son cry
                  for help. She ran out and they killed
                  her. That was near my house. I saw this"

                  Muhammad Arif Sammour

Funny how 'Myths and Facts' does not see fit to include this too - after all
if he is reliable enough to report casualties why not the actual events? What
do you say about this Harry?

                 "In the exchange that followed four men
                  were killed and a dozen were wounded..
                  ..by noon time the battle was over and
                  the shooting had ceased. Although there
                  was a calm, the village had not yet surrendered.
                  The Irgun and Lehi men came
                  out of hiding and began to 'clean' the houses.
                  They shot whoever they saw, women
                  and children included, the commanders did
                  not try and stop the massacre...I
                  pleaded with the commander to order his
                  men to cease fire, but to no avail. In
                  the meantime twenty five Arabs had been
                  loaded on a truck and driven through
                  Mahane-Yehuda and Zichron Yosef. At the
                  end of the drive, they were taken to
                  the quarry bvetween Deir Yassin and Givat
                  Shaul, and murdered in cold blood"

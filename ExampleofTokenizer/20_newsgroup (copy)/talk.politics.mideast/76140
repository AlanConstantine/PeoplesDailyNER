I understand how israel captured the teritory and feels that it
is its right to annex it. I can't fully understand why it has
to deal with palestinians much the same way jews were treated
before the holocaust (the Final Solution) by Hitler. What I
totally don't get is why the U.S. has to subsidize the
existance of such a thorough abuser of human rights.
				Just wondering

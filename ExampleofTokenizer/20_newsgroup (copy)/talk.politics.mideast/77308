[DD] license to lie, cover-up, or revise events under question as we have read 
[DD] on UseNet in postings by agents of the Turkish government. I understand 
[DD] both sides of the issue, but this does not mean I will advocate both sides
[DD] when it suits me. Such a position would make me a hypocrite. I am also not
[DD] being paid by agents of Turkey nor Azerbaijan as are many proponents of 
[DD] the Azeri side. I refer to agents such as Captioline International Group,
[DD] Ltd., being paid in excess of $30,000/month by Azerbaijan. I state my case
[DD] unencumbered by such advocacy or prostitution. 

Thanks to Mr. CG.

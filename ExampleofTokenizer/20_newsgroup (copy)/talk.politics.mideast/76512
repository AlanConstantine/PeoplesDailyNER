There is no known writing directly attributable to Menachem Begin
which admits a massacre at Deir Yassin.  Thus, Hasan is wrong.

The word "troops" is unjustified.  There has never been any evidence
that there were any regular or irregular Arab forces in the village
apart from the villagers defending themselves.  According to the
Haganah observer Pa'il, the Irgun/Lehi forces suffered a lot of
casualties because they were incompetent soldiers.  When they ran
into trouble securing the central part of the village, a small group 
of Palmach soldiers came and took it without a single casualty.
Begin's failure to even mention the Palmach is only one of the
major inaccuracies (to use a kind word) in his account.

Incidentally, "three times as heavy" may be correct, as there is
serious evidence that the Arab loss was closer to 120 lives than
to the oft-quoted 250 lives.  However, note that Begin compares
wounded Jews to dead Arabs.  He fails to mention the number of
wounded Arabs.  Guess why.

As is thoroughly established by many sources, the loudspeaker truck
got stuck in a ditch too far from the village for it to provide a
usueful warning.

It is worth noting how Begin disputes the standard myth that the
Palestinian Arabs fled as part of a calculated plan.

Apparently 90% of Israeli historians are Jew-haters.

I have previously posted quotations by Irgun participants that
totally destroys Begin's whitewash.  I have no particular desire
to post it yet again.

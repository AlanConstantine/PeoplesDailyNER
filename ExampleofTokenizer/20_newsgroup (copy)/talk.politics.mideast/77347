	First of all, this is NOT a strife; this is a massacre of innocent
	Moslem poeples by the Christian West.

	Since Ottoman lost the control of Balkans, many tens and hundereds
	of millions of Muslem peoples (Turks, Albanians, Bosnians, and others) 
	have been tortured, raped, massacred, and driven out of their homes
	by the Cristians of both the region and Europe. Some lucky ones 
	escaped to relative safety in Turkiye. The remaining others are being 
	finished now by local Christians, the USA, and the rest of Europe.

	The Christian West is maintaining a tight arms ambargo on the Muslem
	peoples of Bosnia so they cannot deffend themslves while letting 
	Christian Serbs and Croats torture, rape, and massacre the innocent 
	Moslem peoples of Bosnia.

	It took Christian Europe for almost six centuries to achieve this
	objective of theirs and I do not think they will let it up. This will 
	go on untill every single Moslem person (Bosnian, Turk, Albanian, etc)
	is tortured, raped, massacred, and driven out of their homes.

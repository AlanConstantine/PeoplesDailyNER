Pete--
That was uncalled for. I'm sure Andi Beyer or whatever his name is
was a product of his environment before he came to school, and is
enjoying the mantle of THE UNIVERSITY to make his viewpoint seem
legitimate (well-reasoned). I'm at Virginia, too, and I think 
maligning UVA is in poor taste, even if Beyer did slip in here.

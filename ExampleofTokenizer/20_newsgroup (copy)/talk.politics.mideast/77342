Yea, I think not also. Israel's #1 issue is "Security" so *any* outcomes
of "negotiation" certainly need to address ISREAL'S perception of this
issue.

The problem is is defining (by "outsiders", by Israel, and by the Arabs
themselves) what is the #1 issue to the Arab side. Is it "Palestinian
statehood", is it that Israel as a state should not and must not be
allowed to exist, is it that the existence of a self-governing non-
muslim "state" in the "Islamic World" is intolerable...what? Just as
the dividing line between Israel-fighting-for-security and Israel-fighting-
to-expand is often hard to discern by "outsiders" (especially to the Arab 
world), so the rationale behind the Arab-struggle-to-undermine-Israel-in-
any-way could either be based on visceral rejectionism or a sense of being
wronged that still values peace, who knows which. 

Anyway, in these talks, what "gestures" would you think would be seen
by Israel as "substantial"?

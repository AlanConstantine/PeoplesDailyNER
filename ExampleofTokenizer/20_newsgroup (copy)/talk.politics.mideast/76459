Throughout the years of the Israel/Arab-Palestinian conflict, the internal
Palestinian popultation has found itself essentially relegated to the
lower tiers of the economy. Given the major kinds of positions required
by the Israeli and the "Palestinian" economy, there are essentially two
different ones existing side by side aren't holding down many of the "
skilled" positions. So, when Gaza has to operate on its own, there are 
few residents trained to fill the need for middle and upper management.

Mr. Salah, why are you such a homicidal racist?  Do you feel this
same hatred towards Christans, or is it only Jews?  Are you from
a family of racists?  Did you learn this racism in your home?  Or
are you a self-made bigot?  How does one become such a racist?  I
wonder what you think your racism will accomplish.  Are you under
the impression that your racism will help bring peace in the mid-
east?  I would like to know your thoughts on this.

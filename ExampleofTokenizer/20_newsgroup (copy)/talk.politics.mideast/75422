So far so good...

Old friend, whatever....

That is a great attitude for someone who wants to pressure the Serbs to
accept a peace plan that gives them most of the territory they got by
force and terror.

this is a good thing to hear. Anybody wondering why Serbia is not
really under any boycott? Anybody remembers the Gulf war? Did Saddam
kill 100,000 people and rape 50,000 women?

Still in the threatening stage.. Maybe when there is no more Bosnians,
the UN will lift the arms Embargo on them! Military intervention? that
is reserved for Muslim countries.

NOW HEAR THIS:

real positive I might add, in favor of his old freinds of course!

You bet they are not!

Anybody is still convinced that this is not a religious war?
A psychopath like Karadzik is considered a peacelover.. Of course he
sent 100,000 muslims to permanent peace. With the blessings of Patriarch
Pavle.

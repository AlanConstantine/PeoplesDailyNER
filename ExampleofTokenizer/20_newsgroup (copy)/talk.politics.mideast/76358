Thanks to those who joined millions of Turkish and Kurdish people 
on April 23, 1993 when they remembered, mourned and prayed for 2.5 
million Muslim people who were ruthlessly exterminated by the fascist 
x-Soviet Armenian Government between 1914 and 1920.


The justice is long overdue and the victims of the Turkish Genocide 
demand:

1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian 
Dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;

2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and
Kurdish people;

3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for 
their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;

4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officially
recognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse
to succumb to all Armenian political pressure;

5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it 
has adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially 
recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be 
supportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;

6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact 
of the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of 
2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.

                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks 
                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

                            a single Turkish soul.' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)

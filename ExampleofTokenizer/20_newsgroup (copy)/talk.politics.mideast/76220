After reading the first paragraph, a quick scan confirmed my first
impression: this is a bunch of revisionist and anti-semitic hogwash.

The NY Times reported on April 18, 1993 that the museum "was built
through private contributions on Federal land".  Your hate-mongering
article is devoid of current and historical fact, intellectual content
and social value.  Down the toilet it goes.....

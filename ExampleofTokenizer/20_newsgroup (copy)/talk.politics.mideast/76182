   Are you trying to say that there were no massacres in Deir Yassin

   There is not and was not any such thing like jewish killing in WWII

   Palestinians just did what Davidians did for fourty years and more.

   In fact no one was killed in any war at any time or any place.

   People die that is all. No one gets killed.

   Maybe also vietamiese didn't die in Vietnam war killed by american
   napalm they were just pyromaniacs and that's all.

   Maybe jews just liked gas chambers and no one forced them to get in there.they 
   may be thought it was like snifing cocaine. No?

   What do you think of this ? Isn't it stupid to say so?
   Well it is as stupid as what you said .Next time you want to lie do it
   intelligently.

   Sincerely yours.

Arab civilians did die at Dir yassin. But there was no massacre. First
of all, the village housed many *armed* troops. Secondly, the Irgun
and Stern fighters had absolutely no intentions of killing civilians.
The village was attacked only for its military significance. In fact,
a warning was given to the occupants of the village to leave before
the attack was to begin.

By all rational standards, Dir Yassin was not a massacre. The killing
was unintentional. The village housed Arab snipers and Arab troops.
Thus it was attacked for its military significance. It was not
attacked with intentions of killing any civilians.

To even compare Dir Yassin, in which some 120 or so Arabs died, to the
Holocaust is absurd. The Irgun did not want to kill any civilians. The
village had almost 1000 inhabitants, most of whom survived.

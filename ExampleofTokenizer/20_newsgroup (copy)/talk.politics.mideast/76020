ADL authorities seem to view a lot of people as dangerous, including
the millions of Americans of Arab ancestry.  Perhaps you can answer
the question as to why the ADL maintained files and spied on ADC members
in California (and elsewhere??)?  Friendly rivalry perhaps?

Perhaps Yigal is a Greenpeace member? Or the NAACP? Or a reporter? 
Or a member of any of the dozens of other political organizations/ethnic 
minorities/occupations that the ADL spied on.

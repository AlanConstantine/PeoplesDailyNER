 Morgues fill as Azeris head for all-out war

 Khojaly used to be a barren town, with empty shops and treeless dirt
 roads. Yet it was still home to thousands of people who, in happier
 times, tended fields and flocks of geese. Last week it was wiped off
 the map.

 As sickening reports trickled in to the Azerbaijani border town of
 Agdam, and the bodies piled up in the morgues, there was little doubt
 that Khojaly and the stark foothills and gullies around it had been
 the site of the most terrible massacre since the Soviet Union broke
 apart.
 .......

 I was the last Westerner to visit Khojaly. That was in january and
 people were predicting their fate with grim resignation. Zumrut Ezoya,
 a mother of four on board the helicopter that ferried us into the
 town, called her community "sitting ducks, ready to get shot". She and
 her family were among the victims of the massacre on February 26.

 "The Armenians have taken all the outlying villages, one by one, and
 the government does nothing." Balakisi Sakikov, 55, a father of five,
 said. "Next they will drive us out or kill us all," said Dilbar, his
 wife. The couple, their three sons and three daughters were killed in
 the assault, as were many other people I had spoken to.

 "It was close to the Armenian lines we knew we would have to cross.
 There was a road, and the first units of the column ran across then
 all hell broke loose. Bullets were raining down from all sides. we had
 just entered their trap."
>
 The azeri defenders picked off one by one. Survivors say that Armenian
 forces then began a pitiless slaughter, firing at anything moved in
 the gullies. A video taken by an azeri cameraman, wailing and crying
 as he filmed body after body, showed a grizzly trail of death leading
 towards higher, forested ground where the villagers had sought refuge
 from the Armenians.
>
 "The Armenians just shot and shot and shot," said Omar Veyselov, lying
 in hospital in Agdam with sharapnel wounds. "I saw my wife and
 daughter fall right by me."
>
 People wandered through the hospital corridors looking for news of the
 loved ones. Some vented their fury on foreigners: " Where is my
 daughter, where is my son ?" wailed a mother. "Raped. Butchered. Lost."
>
 Azerbaijan has said as many as 1,000 refugees were killed as they
 tried to flee. The Armenians have denied this, saying the civilians
 were caught in "crossfire".

Are you idiot for real?

     'After all, who remembers today the extermination of the Tartars?'

          "The Turkish Holocaust - Turk Soykirimi", p. 213.)

You must be the only moronian left on the net to believe those 
ASALA/SDPA/ARF forgeries. What a clown...


                    'Kill Turks and Kurds wherever you find them and in 
                     whatever circumstances you find them. Turkish children 
                     also should be killed as they form a danger to the 
                     Armenian nation.' (Hamparsum Boyadjian - 1914)[1]

    Actually Judea and Samaria are proper geographical names, just like 
    Asia Minor or Lake Michigan. Judea and Samaria are even used in 
    an atlas published in (what used to be) USSR circa 1970 that I have at
    home. The government of the USSR was of course quite hostile towards
    Israel and would hardly engage in a pro-Israel propaganda. I would be
    willing to mail a photocopy of the relevant page to Mr. Schmidling 
    with relevant words underlined to simplify his search, if he promises
    to report to the net afterwards.

Mr. Schmidling is to be congtatualted for being living exception to this
general rule. For although he is almost without peer in both the number
of lies posted and in the number of times he repeats them --- he hasn't 
found many people who believe his lies (yet ?).

Someone else said something similar.  I will not comment on the
value or lack of value of Elias's "proposal".  I just want to say
that it is very distressing that at least two people here are
profoundly ignorant of Nazi racial doctrine.  They were NOT
like Elias's idea, they were more like the opposite.  

Nazis believed in racial purity, not racial assimilation.  An 
instructive example is the Nazi attitude to Gypsies.  According to 
Nazi theoreticians, Gypsies were an Aryan race.  They were persecuted,
and in huge numbers murdered, because most European Gypies were
considered not pure Gypsies but "mongrels" formed from the pure Gypsy 
race and other undesirable races.  This was the key difference between 
the theoretical approach to Jews and Gypsies, by the way.  It is also 
true that towards the end of WWII even the "purist" Gypsies were 
hunted down as the theory was forgotten.

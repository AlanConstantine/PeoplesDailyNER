	   Now I have a comment concerning Israeli terrorism
   during the 1930's and 1940's.  The Hirgun, and other branch -
   off militant groups, did fight the British do get them out of
   Palestine.  Yet I fail to see how this Israeli form of
   terrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the
   Arabs.  These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British
   soldiers, but not only thta also killed many Jews who were in
   favor of a compromise with the Palestinians.

The Irgun killed SOLDIERS,  which is a legitimate way to drive an unwanted
fogriend regime from a country.  They didn't kill blindly their families or
such (not as a policy,  I agree that brits which were not soldiers also were
killed sometimes) nor they killed Arabs just for being Arabs.

In case I have to remind you the difference,  the majority of the attacks of
the Arab terrorist organizations was on civilians.  They even tried to
justify their attacks by saying that all Jews in the Israel served in the army
at one point in time or another and therefore are legitimate targets.

   In addition, they
   massacred an entire Palestinian village in 1948, contributing
   to the exodus of the frightened Palestinians who feared their
   very lives.

Yes, these exceptions were tragic mistakes.  I wasn't there and don't have
reffereces handy but from what I heard your description is a bit carried away,
most of the vilagers fled with several dozens,  most of them claimed to be
fighters being killed.

Those "massaceres" are far from being the rule considering that dozens if not
hounders of Arab vilages came under Israeli rule during the same time period.

	   I mention this not because I'm anti semitic [I'm part
   Jewish] but because this self righteousness on the part of the
   Israelites pisses me off so.  I'm not as critical of the
   Palestinians because they were indeed screwed over by the
   Jews.  It 's a damn shame that the Palestinians had to pay for
   German and European anti semitism.

What do you mean "screwed over by the Jews"?  They began the '47 war and
didn't accept the arrgenment planned by the U.N.,  what did you expect the
Jews to do??

Arabs are also Semites.

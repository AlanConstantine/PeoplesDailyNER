But what is Hasan B. Multu's middle name?  I'm not sure, but I heard
it was "Bibo".  I also seem to recall that "Argic" is Azari for "bites
the wax Macedonian".

We don't have a mail address, but how about finding a snail address?
Then instead of quashing Shergold rumors, we could just redirect them
- Ahmed Cosar is a seven year old Greek boy with an incurable case of
crossposting.  His wish is to get into the Usenet Book of World
Records for having the highest noise to signal ratio.

So nice of you all to answer some questions.  And it so nice that most
of you feel that it would be in your hearts to give the Palestinians
some land - most of you focus on the fact that Israel annexed all
this land and it is a kind gesture to give some of it back.  Well,
I hope that after after a state run by Palestinians is established,
the first decision should be to make Jerusalem part of this state -
by annexing it of course.

	Ok, you don't like what I have to say.  Would you care to
demonstrate how the above list, or any expanded version of it you
chose to post, demonstrates fairness in the actions of the UN wrt
Israel?

>luckily, that is not the case. I suggest reading european

	You make the odd assumption that I read Israeli papers, not
European ones.  My main source of news is the Economist, a London
based magazine.

	Also, I do on rare occaisons, read Arab papers, but its hard
to find English language papers from Arab countries here.

>Just don't go off acting like you're objective.

	Have I ever claimed to be objective?  I pointed out, with a 27
item list, that Israel is condemned for actions that other nations are
not condemned for.  You go off and attack me for reading only Israeli
newspapers.

	If you'd like to debate this, please do.  If you'd like to
make ad hominum attacks, feel free to do that too.  But try not to
mask one as another.

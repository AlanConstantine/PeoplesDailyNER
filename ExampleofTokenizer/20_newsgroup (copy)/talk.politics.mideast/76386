Owwww!!  Mr. Jefferson would be clearly disappointed in your designation of 
him as author of the bill of rights.  And your reference to those
in Israel was condesceding and inappropriate.
The Declaratio of Independence of 1776 was written by Thomas Jefferson.
In 1787, the Constitution was drafted by 55 men in Philadelphia.
In 1791, the Bill of Rights was added.  Well, maybe Jefferson
would be flattered.

As to you guys at UVA, your right, not all of you are anti-Jewish,
or self-hating.  But when I visited Charlottesville, I noticed
a distinct lack of diversity, from which I must assume you garner
your inability to perceive the reality of the outside world.

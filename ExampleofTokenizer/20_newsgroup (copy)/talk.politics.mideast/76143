@ o Dr. Namaki,  deputy minister of health stated that infant
@   mortality (under one year old) in Iran went down from 120 
@   per  thousand before the revolution to 33 per thousand at
@   the end of 1371 (last month).
@     
@ o Dr Namaki also stated that before the revolution only
@   254f children received vaccinations to protect them
@   from various deseases but this figure reached 93at
@   the end of 1371.
      
Something funny happens to the percent sign. In paragraph
above, the vaccination rate went from 25 percent to 93 percent.

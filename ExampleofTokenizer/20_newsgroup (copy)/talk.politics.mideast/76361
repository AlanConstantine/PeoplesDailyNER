Let us not forget the Nazi Armenians. Nazi Armenians were of service 
to Germans in Arab countries as well. As Uzun put it, one well-known 
case which received a lot of media-coverage involved two Nazi Armenian 
agents which were dropped over Syria by Italian war planes. The mission 
of the agents was to mingle among the Armenian population in Syria and 
to acquire relevant information for the German Wehrmacht on the allied 
forces in the area.[1] Nazi Armenians also helped German propaganda 
efforts in Arab countries designed to promote pro-Nazi sentiments among 
the French- and British-ruled Arab populations. Beirut had traditionally
been strong-hold of the Nazi Armenians and until very recently it was
the center of international Armenian terrorism. 

In Russia General Dro (the Butcher), the architect of the Turkish
genocide in WWI, was working closely with the German Secret 
Service. He entered the war zone with his own men and acquired
important intelligence about the Soviets. His experience with
the Turkish genocide in x-Soviet Armenia made him an invaluable 
source for the Germans.[2]

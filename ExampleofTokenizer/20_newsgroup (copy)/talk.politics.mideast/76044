The US unlike Israel has massive capital assets, to wit fort Knox for 
one. The accumulated assets of the British empire shiped over in bulk 
to pay for our weapons bill in world war I. Or maybe you thought that the
US occupied the Boer republic that is now South Africa?

Not with Bush at the helm. The gulf war meant that the middle east
was no longer a fringe issue of US politics. The US people had to
be convinced that the US could keep everything hunky dory in that
region.

You realise of course that all this is purely in the interests of allowing
the US citizen to drive arround in a 6 litre car doing single digit
miles to the gallon? Were the US to act responsibly they cvould be
self sufficient in oil.

Syrian occupation ended the civil war. Israeli invasion worstened it.

Its a bit like the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia, reprehensible but 
it put an end to the far worse attrocity that preceeded it. Now Syria
is in the US camp there might even be a possibility of some sort of
democratisation.

What do you expect from an ex French colony? They made a pigs ear of
every single one. The British cocked up Palestine and Pakistan, most
of the others managed to avoid a bloodbath. Compared to Algeria Syria
had it easy.

Clearly offensive in that the original intent was to disloge the PLO from
Lebanon. In the process the civil war was dramatically worsened.

Not at all. Israel is not in Lebanon because to do that would have meant
tens of thousands of dead. Had the US not stopped the Likud nutters from
continuing they would have seriously have threatened Israels survival.
Even in New York there was a massive feeling of revulsion for the Israeli
invasion. It was a complete disaster in PR terms.

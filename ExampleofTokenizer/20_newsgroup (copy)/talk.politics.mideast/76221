O.K., its my turn:

       DRIVING THE JEWS INTO THE SEA ?!

I am sick and tired of this 'DRIVING THE JEWS INTO THE SEA' sentance attributed
to Islamic movements and the PLO; it simply can't be proven as part of their
plan !

(Pro Israeli activists repeat it like parrots without checking its authenticity
since it was coined by Bnai Brith)

What Hamas and Islamic Jihad believe in, as far as I can get from the Arab media,
is an Islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under Koranic
Law. This would be a reversal of the 1948 situation in which the Jews in
Palestine took control of the land and its (mostly Muslim) inhabitants.

However, whoever committed crimes against humanity (torture, blowing up their
homes, murders,...) must be treated and tried as a war criminal. The political
thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the
Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice.

As for the PLO, I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat's mind.

Although their political thinking seems far fetched with Israel acting as a true
super-power in the region, the Islamic movements are using the same weapon the
Jews used to establish their state : Religion.


Ahmed.

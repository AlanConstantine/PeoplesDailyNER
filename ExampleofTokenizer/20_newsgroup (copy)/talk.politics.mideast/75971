Agressive actions are taken by both sides. Tough talk is done by both sides.
When an arab leader is menacing to throw all jews in the water is also tough talk,
I think. And killing people is mildly agressive (justified, in your opinion 
if they are israeli soldiers, justified, in others' opinion if they are jews, not
justified at all in others opinion).

When Brad wrote the article about 3 Israelis killed, ther was a lot of pride 
and satisfaction in his lines. That's what I feel disgusting. We may agree 
or not when a killing is 'technically' murder, but being enthousiastic about it?


And again, I may appreciate some of your points, but you are not objective. That
is not a blame, just a remark.

Just a couple of questions for the pro-Israeli lobby out there:

1) Is Israel's occupation of Southern Lebanon temporary?  For Mr.
Stein:  I am working on a proof for you that Israel is diverting
water to the Jordan River (away from Lebanese territory).

2) Is Israel's occupation of the West Bank, Gaza, and Golan
temporary?  If so (for those of you who support it), why were so
many settlers moved into the territories?  If it is not temporary,
let's hear it.

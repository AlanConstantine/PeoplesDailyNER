[FARID] In support of the preservation of the territorial integrity of 
[FARID] Azerbaijan and its independence from Russian rule, the Iranians which 
[FARID] includes millions of Azerbaijanis will have Armenia retreat from the 
[FARID] territory of Azerbaijan. 

Oh, they will? This should prove quite interesting!

[FARID] To count on Iranian help to supposedly counter Turkish influence will 
[FARID] be a fatal error on the part of Armenia as long as Armenia in 
[FARID] violation of international law has Azerbaijani lands in occupation. 

Armenia is not counting on Iranian help. As far as violations of international
laws, which international law gives Azerbaijan the right to attack and 
depopulate the Armenians in Karabakh?

[FARID] If Armenian aggression continues in the territory of Azerbaijan, not 
[FARID] only there won't be any aid from Iran to Armenia but also steps will 
[FARID] be taken to have Armenian army back in Armenia. 

And who do you speak for? Rafsanjani?

[FARID] The Azerbaijanis of Iran will be the guarantors of this policy. As for 
[FARID] scaring Iranians or Turks from the Russian power, experts on present 
[FARID] and future military potentials of these people would not put much 
[FARID] stock on the Russain power as the sole power in the region for long!!! 

Well, Farid, your supposed experts are not expert! The Russians have had
non-stop influence in the Caucasus since the Treaty of Turkmanchay in 1828.
Hmm... that makes it 1993-1828 = 165 years! 

Oh, I see the Azeris from Iran are going to force out the Armenians from 
Karabakh! That will be a real good trick! 

[FARID] Iran is not alian to developing the capability to produce the A bomb 
[FARID] and a reliable delivery system (refer to recent news releases 
[FARID] regarding the potential of Iran). 

So the Azeris from Iran are going to force the Armenians from Karabakh by
forcing the Iranian government to drop an atomic bomb on these Armenians.

[FARID] The moral of the story is that, you don't go invading your neighbor's 
[FARID] home (Azerbaijan) and flash Russia's guns when questioned about it. 

Oh, but it's just fine if you drop an atomic bomb on your neighbor! You are
a damn fool, Farid!

[FARID] (Marshal Shapashnikov may have to eat his words regarding Turkey in a 
[FARID] few short years!). 

So you are going to drop an atomic bomb on Russia as well. 

[FARID] Peaceful resolution of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict is the only 
[FARID] way to go. Armenia may soon find the fruits of Aggression very bitter 
[FARID] indeed.

And the Armenians will take your "peaceful" dropping of an atomic bomb as
an example of Iranian Azeri benevolence! You sir are a poor example of an 
Iranian Azeri! 

Ha! And to think I had a nice two day stay in Tabriz back in 1978!

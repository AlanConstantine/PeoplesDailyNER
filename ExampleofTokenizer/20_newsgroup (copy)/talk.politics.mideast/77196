I'm not sure about this but I hope the answer is that you can't apply under
the law of return.  By conversion, you've elected not to be a part of the
Jewish nation.

At the moment you converted, you officially anounced to the world that *you* do not
consider yourself to be part of the Jewish Nation.  So, why should the Jewish Nation
consider you to be a member?

No.  As a result of wars brought by the Arabs against the Jews in an attempt to
annihilate Israel, the Arabs have lost their claim to land there.  Attacking Israel
is/was illegal and they now have to pay the price.  Do I feel sorry for the
Palestinians?  Yes I do.  But I blame the Arab nations for their problems, not
Israel.

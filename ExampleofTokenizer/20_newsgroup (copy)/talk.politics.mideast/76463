[TC] Do you, as I do, agree that this (sort) of "peace process" is needed?
[TC] What about the particular points mentioned in the article? Is what
[TC] Israel is (supposedly) going to propose "good"? Does it go too far?
[TC] Not far enough?

[TC] If you don't agree that a "peace process" is needed, what is?

I personally think that a peace process is needed, since only through
negotiations will the future generations be able to live in stability.
Unfortunately not all think like this, we have cases like:
	Anas Omran, Hamza Saleh, Jle, Mohammed Reza, Mehmed Abu-Abed, 
Anwar Mohammed and others who think that JIHAD is the only solution. 

I wish that people (including myself) would have more objective views like Tim,
Basil and Shai for example and put the rhetoric aside and start discussing
"substance".

My view is that Israel has made more gestures towards its Arab foes than the
opposite. What have the Sysrians given to us or proposed? What have the
Palestinians proposed? If the Palestinians would just revoke or rewrite their 
charter, or just condemn acts of Palestinian violence that would be a good
start.
The Palestinians have all to gain from these negotiations. Its seems though
that they are not strong enough to make decisions on their own and are
plagued by internal strife, that is why we are not getting anywhere.
Fundamentalism is slowly taking over in the territories, then it will be
too late to discuss issues with the Palestinians since they will only
vow for the destruction of Israel.
Arabs  must take example on Egypt. Egypt came to the bargaining table,
got what it wanted from Israel and there is now peace and cooperation
between the two countries. 
The tougher you play ball with Israel the tougher Israel gets.

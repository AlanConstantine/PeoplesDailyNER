  Please clarify your standards for rules of engagement.  As I
  understand it, Israelis are at all times and under all
  circumstances fair targets.  Their opponents are legitimate
  targets only when Mirandized, or some such?

  I'm sure that this makes perfect sense if you grant *a*priori*
  that Israelis are the Black Hats, and that therefore killing
  them is automatically a Good Thing (Go Hezbollah!).  The
  corollary is that the Hezbollah are the White Hats, and that
  whatever they do is a Good Thing, and the Israelis only prove
  themselves to be Bad Guys by attacking them.

  This sounds suspiciously like a hockey fan I know, who cheers
  when one of the players on His Team uses his stick to permanently
  rearrange an opponent's face, and curses the ref for penalizing
  His Side.  Of course, when it's different when the roles are
  reversed.

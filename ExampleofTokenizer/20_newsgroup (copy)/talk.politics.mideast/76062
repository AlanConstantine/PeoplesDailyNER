I know this paper well, and see it for the exercise in selective morality 
and judgement it is. Until such time as it recognizes that *any* religiously
based government is racist, exclusionary and simply built on a philosophy
of "separate but equal" second-class treatment of minorities, it will 
continue to be known for its bias. If Jewish nationalism is racism, so is 
Islam; anywhere where people are allotted "different rights" according to 
race, religion or culture is "racist".

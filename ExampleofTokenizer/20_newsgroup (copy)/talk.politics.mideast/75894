I am not in the business of reading minds, however in this case it would not
be necessary.  Israelis top leaders in the past and present, always come across
as arrogant with their tough talks trying to intimidate the Arabs.  

The way I see it, Israelis and Arabs have not been able to achieve peace
after almost 50 years of fighting because of the following two major reasons:

 1) Arab governments are not really representative of their people, currently
    most of their leaders are stupid, and/or not independent, and/or
    dictators.

 2) Israeli government is arrogant and none comprising.

        ``It's horrible. People are trying to get their wives and children
out, men are leaving their defense positions, it's total anarchy,'' said
Mekhman Aliyev, a spokesman for the Azerbaijani president.

        Aliyev said 210 people -- three-quarters of them civilians, the rest
government soldiers -- had been killed and 200 wounded in the assault by
Armenian fighters.

The Jerusalem Post is only a small part of the Israeli media ( One
that caters to outsiders for the most part, anyways).

If you never read Ha'aretz, Maariv, or other Hebrew langauge papers
, or at least seen some of their articles translated, you are not
really getting the Israeli media.

Inlcuding some of the left-leaning ones?

A -6 to a -10? Is that why stations such as PBS have run shows which
do not depict the Israeli standpoint at all?

IS that why the Intifada got more coverage in 1987 and 1988 than did
Saddamn gassing Kurds by the thousands?

I am from Montreal. I read the Suburban. Did they ever advocate the
Kahane stupidity of expelling the Arabs? Are they racist?

The Suburban has some columnists that explain the Israeli standpoint.

They are nothing like Kahane. IN any case, the Suburban is a paper
with a minor local distribution and no influence.

So what source is the closest thing to a zero?

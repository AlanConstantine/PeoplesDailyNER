The Arab Association for Human Rights (HRA) was 
formed in 1988 to address discriminatory practices and 
human rights abuses by Israel against its Palestinian 
citizens.

It is a unique association concerned with the civil, 
political, economic, social and cultural rights of the 
Palestinian national minority in Israel. Among the issues 
of concern are land confiscation, education, prison 
conditions, unemployment, torture and the unequal 
allocation of Israel's resources.

Today there are around 800,000 Palestinian Arabs living 
within the Green line (the pre-1967 borders of Israel), 
constituting 18% of Israel's citizens. For them it is an 
empty citizenship in a system geared exclusively for the 
needs of the Jewish population. Legally and practically, 
Israel has proclaimed itself a Jewish state and early 
promises of equality for non-Jewish citizens have not 
been fulfilled. This is apparent in many areas strongly 
affecting the Palestinian national minority.

Most Arab agricultural land has been confiscated since 
1948. The Arab sector is vastly underfunded and does 
not receive a fair share of state resources. On a day-to-
day level, Palestinians face discrimination in many 
different forms and find it is a struggle to get permission 
to build a house, start a business, find a job or educate 
their children.

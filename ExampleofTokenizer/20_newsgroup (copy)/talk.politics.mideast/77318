Let me improve this one for you, then. For nearly one thousand years, 
the Turkish and Kurdish people lived on their homeland - the last 
one hundred under the oppressive Soviet and Armenian occupation. The 
persecutions culminated in 1914: The Armenian Government planned and 
carried out a Genocide against its Muslim subjects. 2.5 million Turks 
and Kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their homeland. 
After one thousand years, Turkish and Kurdish lands were empty of Turks
and Kurds. 

The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye.

Today, x-Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and 
Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x-Soviet Armenia.

Today, x-Soviet Armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its 
predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against 
humanity.

x-Soviet Armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the Muslims 
by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the Turks and Kurds.

Turks and Kurds demand the right to return to their lands,
to determine their own future as a nation in their own homeland.

...On this occasion, we once again reiterate the unquestioned 
justice of the restitution of Turkish and Kurdish rights and...

- We demand that the x-Soviet Armenian Government admit its 
responsibility for the Turkish and Kurdish Genocide, render 
reparations to the Muslim people, and return the land to its 
rightful owners. The recognition of the Genocide has become an 
issue which cannot be delayed further, and it is imperative that 
artificial obstacles created for political manipulations be removed.

- We believe the time has come to demand from the the United States 
that it formally recognizes the Turkish and Kurdish Genocide, adopts 
the principles of our demands and refuses to accede to Armenian pressures 
to the contrary.

- As taxpayers of the United States, we express our vehement 
protest to the present U.S. Government policy of continued 
coddling, protection and unqualified assistance towards x-Soviet
Armenia.

- Our territorial demands are strictly aimed at x-Soviet Armenia's.

p. 52 (second paragraph).

"Your three chiefs, Dro, Hamazasp and Kulkhandanian are the ringleaders
 of the bands which have destroyed Tartar villages and have staged 
 massacres in Zangezour, Surmali, Etchmiadzin, and Zangibasar. This is
 intolerable. Look - and here he pointed to a file of official documents
 on the table - look at this, here in December are the reports of the last
 few months concerning ruined Tartar villages which my representative
 Wardrop has sent me. The official Tartar communique speaks of the
 destruction of 300 villages."

p. 54 (fifth paragraph).

"Yes, of course. I repeat, until this massacre of the Tartars is stopped
 and the three chiefs are not removed from your military leadership I
 hardly think we can supply you arms and ammunition."

"...it is the armed bands led by Dro, Hamazasp and Kulkhandanian who
 during the past months have raided and destroyed many Tartar villages in
 the regions of Surmali, Etchmiadzin, Zangezour, and Zangibasar. There are
 official charges of massacres."

And we all know what an unbiased source the NYT is when it comes to things
concerning Israel.

Neither the Times nor the trained seals who have responded thus far seem to
recognize the statement that these "private funds" were all tax exmpt.  In
otherwords, American taxpayers put up at least 30% of the money.  And
finalyy, how does "Federal land" mitigate the offensiveness of this alien
monument dedicated to perpetuating pitty and the continual flow of tax money
to a foreign entity?

That "Federal land" and tax money could have been used to commerate
Americans or better yet, to house homeless Americans.

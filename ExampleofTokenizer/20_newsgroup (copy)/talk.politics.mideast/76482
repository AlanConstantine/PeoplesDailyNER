	The Palestine mandate had no borders before
the borders were negotiated and drawn.  The most the Golan may have been
is on the list of what territories Britian would have liked to
see in the palestine mandate.
	Until the mandates came into existance, there were no defined
boundaries between any of the various territories in the region.

	If you have a source for any of these claims, then please
present it.

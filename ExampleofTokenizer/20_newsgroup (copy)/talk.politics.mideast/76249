  Note the clause "more forcibly", above.     My point is that they have
  made a few pro-forma, perfunctory remarks, and sent in a few C-130's and
  so forth, but it's clearly not something they're losing much sleep over.
  They're just going through the motions, while Moslems are being "ethnically
  cleansed" out of what used to be Yugoslavia.   The US has been speaking
  out far more loudly than the Moslem nations in the UN and other world
  forums.

  Precisely.   Humanitarian concerns were not the primary justification
  for US involvement in the Gulf - oil and geopolitics were.  If the 
  the Kuwaitis didn't have oil (and assuming Iraq still saw fit to 
  invade them) I doubt you would have seen Operation Desert Storm.

Please cite specific examples where an Arab party member was rejected
while a Jewish party member was accepted.  If you examine these I am
sure you will discover that the Arab party member did not have the power
base that his Jewish counterpart had.  The party structure in Israel
has changed quite a bit insofar as knesset member elections go.  Knesset
members for most parties are now elected via primaries.  The top standing
members end up with cabinet posts.  This is purely a political power
issue.  Check the ranking of Arab labor party members, as opposed
to Jewsih members and let me know which posts are held by Jews that
ranked lower in the party than their Arab fellow electees.

Once again, if for arguments sake, all the Arab Israelis were to vote
for Labor at the next election, you can rest assured that the number of
Arab MKs and cabinet members would increase proportionately to the
power shift.

You are overlooking the fact that they wield political power
as individuals based upon a wider collective power base.

The reasoning I see at work is purely political.  As far as security
goes I think that some serious gaffs were made by right wing Jews
as well - e.g. Sharon.

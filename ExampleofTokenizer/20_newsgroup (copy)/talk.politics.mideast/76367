[SB] Oh yeah, Israel was really ready to "expand its borders" on the holiest day

[SB] OPPOSITE to the point you are trying to make?  I don't think that it's
[SB] because it was the war that hit Israel the hardest.  Also, in 1967 it was
[SB] Egypt, not Israel who kicked out the UN force.  In 1948 it was the Arabs
[SB] who refused to accept the existance of Israel BASED ON THE BORDERS SET

[SB] shipping, a clear antagonistic act.  And in 1982 the attack was a response
[SB] to years of constant shelling by terrorist organizations from the Golan

[SB] finally retaliated.  Nowhere do I see a war that Israel started so that 
[SB] the borders could be expanded.

I agree with all you write except that Terrorist orgs. were not shelling
Israel from the Golan Heights in 1982, but rather from Lebanon. The Golan
Heights have been held by Israel since 1967, and therefore the PLO could
not have been shelling Israel from there, unless there is something I am
not aware of.

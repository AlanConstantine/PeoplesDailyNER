Not so fast! You have a rather warped sense of logic! You are telling us that
because Israel wishes to have good relations with Turkey even at the expense
of Armenians or Armenia, makes it bad for Turks to tell racist jokes against 
Jews. Thus, we can infer, if Israel had poor relations with Turkey, it would
be alright to post such horrible jokes against Jews! 

You impress nobody.

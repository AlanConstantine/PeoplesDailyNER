Please list the names of some of those neutral reporters that were killed
in the "O.T.".  It is also interesting to note that at the outbreak of
the intifada, palestinian parties quickly began orchestrating their
demonstrations for the benefit of the media.  Having spoken to a Danish
reporter who covered the initfada, I know of at least one case where
he found out that a "mass demonstration" on the outskirts of Gaza was
setup for himself and his colleagues.  When I asked whether the footage
shot was sent he replied affirmatively, "after all, it did happen."
When this became the case, the IDF began closing sensitive trouble
spots to reporters.

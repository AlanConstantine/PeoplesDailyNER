I hope, I hope, that we can begin to involve ourselves in the issues
and concerns related to this peace process. We have differing opinions,
certainly, on these aspects but it is clear that we all share the hope
that "resolution" of the tensions and conflict **will** happen.

As we "run to the defense" of our side, there is no need to constantly 
involve ourselves in name-calling. All of us are regularly confused by
the "other's" reactive posting because "they" spend most of the post
applying "labels" and presenting slogans than in just presenting their
honest views. Then...when we "react", we do the same thing.

Do you, as I do, agree that this (sort) of "peace process" is needed?
What about the particular points mentioned in the article? Is what
Israel is (supposedly) going to propose "good"? Does it go too far?
Not far enough?

If you don't agree that a "peace process" is needed, what is?

You shouldn't think many Turks read Mutlu/Argic stuff.
They are in my kill file, likewise any other fanatic.

Well, Panos, Mr. Tamamidis?, the way you put it it is only the Turks
who bear the responsibility of the things happening today. That is hard to
believe for somebody trying to be objective.
When it comes to conflicts like our countries having you cannot
blame one side only, there always are bad guys on both sides.
What were you doing on Anatolia after the WW1 anyway?
Do you think it was your right to be there?
I am not saying that conflicts started with that. It is only
not one side being the aggressive and the ither always suffering.
It is sad that we (both) still are not trying to compromise.
I remember the action of the Turkish government by removing the
visa requirement for greeks to come to Turkey. I thought it
was a positive attempt to make the relations better.

The Greeks I mentioned who wouldn't talk to me are educated
people. They have never met me but they know! I am bad person
because I am from Turkey. Politics is not my business, and it is
not the business of most of the Turks. When it comes to individuals 
why the hatred? So that makes me think that there is some kind of
brainwashing going on in Greece. After all why would an educated person 
treat every person from a nation the same way? can you tell me about your 
history books and things you learn about Greek-Turkish
encounters during your schooling. 
take it easy!

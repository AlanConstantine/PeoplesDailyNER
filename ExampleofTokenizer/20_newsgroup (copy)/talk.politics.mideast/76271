Like it or not, Edward, Anwar has a very good, valid point.  Obviously,
in presenting it, he (quite legitimately and deliberately) takes a point
of view to an extreme which might not have been what you intended, but
that is one of the best ways to demonstrate a "slippery slope" type of
argument, which I believe was his aim.

I very frankly believe that the ADL will be proved innocent in this
case.  I doubt there's enough evidence to weigh against them even in a
civil court, where preponderance of the evidence, not evidence beyond
any reasonable doubt, is the standard for "winning" such a case.  That,
however, does not prevent me from seeing the merit in Anwar's point.

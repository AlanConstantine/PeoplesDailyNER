Israelophiles?  Is this anything like Israelists?  You're treading on
thin ice here.

Now, you're falling through the ice.  Barfie!  We have a playmate for
you!

There is a difference between guerrilla warfare and terrorism.
The former primarily targets enemy soldiers.  The latter primarily
targets civilians, and not necessarily enemy civilans, at that.

Innocent British soldiers?  Like innocent Iraqi soldiers?
THe British were EXECUTING Jewish fighters in what was soon to become
the recognized Jewish homeland.  The British - to their eternal shame
and damnation - were sending shiploads of Jewish refugees, civilians,
back to Europe to be taken care of by Hitler.

By comparison, Palestinean "fighters" primarily target tourists,
schoolchildren, babies, worshippers, shoppers, movie-goers and other
such threatening people.  Early Zionist fighters did no such things.

Your comparison is ignorant and odious.

Does it bug you that the "Israelites" (they used to be
Israelophiles...) happen to be right?

Are you kidding?  Palestinean Arabs - who comprise a tiny proportion 
of the world's refugee population, who have almost no justifiable
claim to the territory that they desire, who have acted as criminals
in the international community for decades - are being treated like
the most aggrieved and deserving minority in existence, even after
their ignominious support for Saddam in Desert Storm.  How many other
world "leaders" have addressed the UN with a machine-gun in hand,
receiving a standing ovation?

You are now parrotting some of the weakest arguments of the
terrorists' apologists.  Congratulations.

Gee, that's a nice name.  Can I call you Pissed?

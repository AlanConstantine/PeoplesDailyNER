What is so honorable about placing bombs in passenger airliners,
promising to execute Rushdie, killing 1-2 million people in the
Iran/Iraq war, murdering tourists and persecuting ethinc Christians in
Egypt, massacring Christians in Sudan, harassing Christians in and 
barring Jews from Saudi Arabia?  How are paranoid Muslims "righteous
in defending themsselves" in these situations?  Who are they even
afraid of?

the Middle East in any country besides Israel.

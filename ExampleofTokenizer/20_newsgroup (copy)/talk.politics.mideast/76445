It is all so changed by now. but in case any of you is
interested in what I actually said, I never compared the
Israeli treatment of the palestinians with the Holocaust.
Anyway that is the truth if it matters. I was about to forget
about it myself since everyone started calling me anti-semitic
for making the comparison that I never made. What I did say was
that the Nazis didn't start with the Holocaust and their
initial actions were similar to what the Israelis are doing now.
	The Jews that were stranded on the polish border since
no country accepted them are like the arabs stranded on the
lebenese border. No trials, no hearing, just expulsion based on
guilt due to race.

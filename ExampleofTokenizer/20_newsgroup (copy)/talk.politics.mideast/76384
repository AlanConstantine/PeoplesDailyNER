	Do you have a problem with the language? I said
everyone suffered emotionally because they sympathyzed with the
victims of Holocaust. I wasn't implying that anyone suffered
more than the actual victims. Neither was I implying any
wrongdoing on the part of the Jews as the cause for the
Holocaust. What is wrong with you guys? Regardless of what one 
says you keep hearing what you want to hear.

In Re:Syria's Expansion, the author writes that the UN thought
Zionism was Racism and that they were wrong.  They were correct
the first time, Zionism is Racism and thankfully, the McGill Daily
(the student newspaper at McGill) was proud enough to print an article
saying so.  If you want a copy, send me mail.

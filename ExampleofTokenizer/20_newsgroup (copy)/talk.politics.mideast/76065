Yes, Israel has nuclear weapons. However:

1) Their use so far has been restricted to killing deer, by LSD addicted
   "Cherrie" soldiers.

2) They are locked in the cellar of the "Garinei Afula" factory, and since
   the Gingi lost the key, no one can use them anymore.

3) Even if the Gingi finds the key, the chief Rabbis have a time lock
   on the bombs that does not allow them to be activated on the Sabbath
   and during weeks which follow victories of the Betar Jerusalem soccer
   team. A quick glance at the National League score table will reveal
   the strategic importance of this fact.

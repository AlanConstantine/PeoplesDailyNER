I don't know anything about this particular case, but *other*
governments have been known to follow events on the Usenet.  For
example after Tienanmien Square in Beijing the Chinese government
began monitoring cyberspace.  As the former Director of PeaceNet,
I am aware of many incidents of local, state, national and
international authorities monitoring Usenet and other conferences
such as those on the Institute for Global Communications.  But
what's the big deal?  You shouldn't advocate illegal acts in this
medium in any case.  If you are concerned about being monitored,
you should use encyrption software (available in IGC's "micro"
conference).  I know for a fact that human rights activists in the
Balkan-Mideast area use encryption software to send out their
reports to international organizations.  Such message *can* be
decoded however by large computers consuming much CPU time, which
probably the Turkish government doesn't have access to.

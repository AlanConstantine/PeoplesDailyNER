OK, you've already disqualified yourself (who ever you are) from
being objective.

Jews are a people with a common cultural heritage, religion, and history.
We are not a race.

You don't see a difference between killing British soldiers (who were
preventing Jews who tried to escape the Nazis from entering the
British mandate) and Arab terrorist who kill civilian men, women, and
children?!?

That's ridiculuous on atleast two counts.  First of all, even if you identify
yourself as completely Jewish that doesn't rule out the possibility that you're
a self-hating anti-semite.  One can always find Jews who are uncomfortable with
their identities (since they only want Jews to be cowering victims) and are
willing to speak up for their enemies.  Secondly, the strength or weakness of
your arguments does not depend on your identity.

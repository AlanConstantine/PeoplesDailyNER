I asked some simple questions at different occations. I don't understand why
some people insulted me for those SIMPLE questions!
Anyway, I didn't reply to them with the same language and I won't, because

1. There is no need
2. There is no benefit 
3. I don't have time  to reply to those garbages

By the way, do you want to know who am I? I am not a NATIONALIST Arab of 1967.
 I am not a COMONIST Arab of 70's. Are you sure that you want to hear
 my name? I am a MUSLIM FIGHTER. I am the same child who 
fight with your armed soldier with stone! I am the same guy who wants to 
bring JUSTICE to Palestine, I am the same fighter who wants to kicked Israel
out of south Lebonon in the same way of the  1982. I am the son of KHOMEINI.
I am honored to be a HEZBULLAH.... Don't you know me!!!? Just ask Rabin
he knows me! 

Hamid

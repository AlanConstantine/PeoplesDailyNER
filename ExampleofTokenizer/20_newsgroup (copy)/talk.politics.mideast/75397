	This is such a fine example of Jack's antisemitic bigotry that I 
couldn't help but do a follow-up. 

	A poster attempts to discuss an event rationally, with no indication
at all that he is identified with any specific ethnic group - he is merely
talking in terms that might apply to ANY group in similar circumstances.

	Schmidling comes back with a rabid attack against YOU PEOPLE, as if
it were crystal clear that the Jewish people as a whole were culpable for this
man's statements - even if he were not Jewish. Jack considers the Jewish people
to be responsible for all the acts of the supporters of Israel, irrespective of
their age, religion, gender, skin color, or sexual orientation.

	The .sig, please.

The cases aren't really comparable.  A project like a freeway requires
public hearings, court action, appeals, advance determination of
restitution, and so on.  The razing of the Moghrabi district in East
Jerusalem happened within hours of the end of the hostilities of the 6
Day War.  The residents were given only two or three hours' notice to
pack up and find accomodations elsewhere.  They had no chance of
public hearing, debate, appeal, negotiation or anything.  It was get
out or die in the rubble.

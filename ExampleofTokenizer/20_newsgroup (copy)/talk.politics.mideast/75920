David posts a good translation of a post by Suat Kinikliouglu:

[most of the original post elided]

   [KK] ***** VATAN SEVGISI RUHLARI KIRDEN KURTARAN EN KUVVETLI RUZGARDIR *****

   In translation, as a public service:

[most of the translation elided]

   ***** THE LOVE OF THE FATHERLAND IS THE STRONGEST OF ALL WINDS CLEANSING
         FILTH OFF SOULS *****

I think this part of the translation is questionable. Although I
think the original quote is plain silly, you made it sound as if
it is coming from a neo-nazi youth. For example, Turks talk of a
"motherland" not a Germanic "fatherland". Why "filth" instead of
"dirt"? The indeterminacy of translation is a well-known problem
[1] so one may have to "fudge", but with some care of course. Is
the following an equally valid translation?

The love of one's country is the strongest wind to cleanse one's
soul.

See my point?

Nevertheless, I think you translate well.

There are many neutral human rights organizations which always report
on the situation in the O.T.  But, as most people used to see on TV, the
Israelis do not allow them to go deep there in the O.T.  The Israelis 
used to arrest and sometimes to kill some of these neutral reporters.  
So, this is another kind of terrorism committed by the Jews in Palestine.
They do not allow fair and neutral coverage of the situation in Palestine.

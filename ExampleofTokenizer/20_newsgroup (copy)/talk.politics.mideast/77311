     Our white knight for Islam rides in again! Our instant expert
on religion, race and ethnicity is at the door! Stand back all. Let 
him through. He's going to single-handedly rescue Islam from all these
dastardly mistakes, misquotes, misconceptions.

     Did it occur to you that there is such a thing as Bosnian Serbs
who aren't necessarily outsiders? And while you're at it, could you
please pontificate a little bit about your Islamic pals in the Sudan
who are running amuck in the South, kidnapping women and children
and, in essence, doing the same thing? How come we don't hear your 
wonderful treatises on what's happening
out there?

There were a couple millions of Greeks living in Asia Minor until 1923.
Someone had to protect them. If not us who??

Compromise on what, the invasion of Cyprus, the involment of Turkey in
Greek politics, the refusal of Turkey to accept 12 miles of territorial
waters as stated by international law, the properties of the Greeks of 
Konstantinople, the ownership of the islands in the Greek lake,sorry, Aegean.

There are some things on which there can not be a compromise.

Any person who supports the policies of the Turkish goverment directly or
indirecly is a "bad" person.
It is not your nationality that makes you bad, it is your support of the
actions of your goverment that make you "bad".
People do not hate you because of who you are but because of what you
are. You are a supporter of the policies of the Turkish goverment and
as a such you must pay the price.

You do not need brainwashing to turn people against the Turks. Just talk to
Greeks, Arabs, Slavs, Kurds and all other people who had the luck to be under
Turkish occupation.
They will talk to you about murders,rapes,distruction.

You do not learn about Turks from history books, you learn about them from
people who experienced first hand Turkish friendliness.

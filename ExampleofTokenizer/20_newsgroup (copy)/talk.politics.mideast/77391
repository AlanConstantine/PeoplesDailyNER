The above explained propaganda which certainly has nothing to do with 
the true facts is also today the main source of ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists'
illegal activities that still try to make money out of the bodies of 
the innocent victims of the Turkish genocide.

The criminal acts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government come directly
under the scope of the Convention on Genocide adopted by the General 
Assembly of the United Nations on December 8, 1948, containing the 
following provisions:

The Contracting Parties, having considered the declaration made 
by the General Assembly of the United Nations in its Resolution
95 (1) dated December 11, 1946, that genocide is a crime under
international law, contrary to the spirit and aims of the United
Nations and condemned by the civilized world;

Recognizing that in all periods of history genocide has inflicted
great losses on humanity; and

Being convinced that, in order to liberate mankind from such odious
scourge, international cooperation is required;

Members agree as hereinafter provided:

Article 1. The Contracting Parties confirm that genocide, whether
committed in time of peace or in time of war, is a crime under 
international law which they undertake to prevent and to punish.

Article 2. In the present Convention genocide means any of the
following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or
in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as 
such:

A) Killing member of the group;
B) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;
C) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life 
   calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole 
   or in part;
D) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;
E) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group;

Article 3. The following acts shall be punishable:

a) Genocide
b) Conspiracy to commit genocide
c) Direct and public incitement to commit genocide
d) Attempt to commit genocide.

Article 4. Persons committing genocide or any of the other acts
enumerated in Article 3 shall be punished, whether they are
constitutionally responsible rulers, public officials or private
individuals.

Had the Convention on Genocide existed before the Armenian 
massacres of the Turks and Kurds, it would probably have been 
difficult for the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its responsibles
to start murdering of civilian, defenseless, faithful Ottoman
citizens, children and women, (GENOCIDE AND ATTEMPT TO GENOCIDE),
to make plans to exterminate, as they have done also to Urartus
and Jews, faithful Ottoman citizens (CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT GENOCIDE), 
to incite Armenians to armed revolt against the legal authority
and to commit Genocide, (DIRECT AND PUBLIC INCITEMENT TO COMMIT
GENOCIDE).

	Quite a few people couldn't have cared less about what
happened to the Jews of Europe.  If they had cared, they would have
done something.

	Maybe its because many of us, who have been on usenet for
several years remember tripe like this being posted:

|a typical jew leader, huh?

	This was posted fairly recently.  There has been much more
racist stuff in the past.  Why are we expected to listen to it and
remain "calm?"  I don't think that listening to racist or anti-semetic
slurs is an incitement to calm debate.

	Perhaps you don't mean to be coming off as highly offensive.
However, the way you have posted seems to be typical of those who have
an irrational dislike for Israel and Jews.  Perhaps if you took a
close look at what you've posted thought a bit about the combatative
tone you've used, you would see why people are reacting the way they
are.

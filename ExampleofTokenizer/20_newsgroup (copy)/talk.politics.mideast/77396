        What if we remove one zeron and make it "the genocide of two hundred
        thousands Muslims in Bosnia..", would that make it any better..?
        And how about the 2,000,000 Muslims who were driven and continue to
        be driven out of their homes..? is that "utterly ridiculous claim"?
        And how about the rapes (over 60,000 women) and the concentration 
        camps..? The us delegation which visited them reported yesterday
        on CNN that the serbs are giving the muslims detainees 4 biscuits
        and a cup of water a day..!!??
        That sure also sounds like an "utterly ridiculous claim".!

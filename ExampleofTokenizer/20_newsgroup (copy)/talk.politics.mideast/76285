What do you mean by that ? Anyway in Greece, as in every  country if you want
some property you 'inform' the goverment .

Well well well. When Turkish in Area of Komotini elect 1 out of 3
represenatives of this area to GReek parliament, if not freedom what is it?
3 out of 3 ? Maybe there are only Turks living there ....

I cannot deny that actions of fanatics from both sides were reported.
A minority of Greek idiots indeed attack religious places, which
were protected by the Greek police. Photographs of Greek policemen

Oh NO. PLEASE DO GIVE AS A BRAKE !
Minorities in Turkish treated like that ? YOur own countrymen die
in the prisons every day bacause of their political beliefs, an this
is reported by Turks, and you want us to believe tha Turkey is the paradise
of Human rights ?  Business of Greeks i Turkey? Yes 80 years ago !
You seem to be intelligent, so before presenting Turkey as the paradise of
Human rights just invastigate this matter a bit more.

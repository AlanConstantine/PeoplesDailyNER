   Andy Beyer has claimed that the Israeli Press is a bit biased.
But the fact is that there are events shaping the politics of the
mideast that people who do not read the Israeli press simply know
nothing about.  Many of these events are not even mentioned here.
I read the Israeli press to learn of important events about which
you know nothing, because of your total reliance on western media
for your information on Israel.  Since I read both American media
and Israeli media, I can say with absolute certainty that anybody
who reliesx exclusively on the American press for knowledge about
Israel does not have a true picture of what is going on.

   As to the claim that Israeli papers are biased, of course they
are.  Some may lean to the right or the left, just like the media
here in America.  But they still report events about which people
here know nothing.  I choose to form my opinions about Israel and
the mideast based on more knowledge than does an average American
who relies exclusively on an American media which does not report
on events in the mideast with any consistency or accuracy.

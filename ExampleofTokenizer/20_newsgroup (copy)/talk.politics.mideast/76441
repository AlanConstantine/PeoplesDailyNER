If you _know_ that the number is "so high", would you care to provide it?  
To tell you the truth, Hamid, most of those killed by the Israeli Army were
agressors who were invading or attacking Israel with the intention of murdering
Jews and destroying the Jewish State.  Thus, I have no sympathy for them and
I really don't give a damn about how many were killed.

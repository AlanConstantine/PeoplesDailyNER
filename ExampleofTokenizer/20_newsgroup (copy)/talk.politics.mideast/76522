Well, you should have noted that I was cheering an attack on an Israeli 
patrol INSIDE Lebanese territory while I was condemning the "retaliatory"
shelling of Lebanese villages by Israeli and Israeli-backed forces. My "team",
you see, was "playing fair" while the opposing team was rearranging the
faces of the spectators in my team's viewing stands, so to speak. 

I think that you should try to find more sources of news about what goes on
in Lebanon and try to see through the propaganda. There are no a priori
black and white hats but one sure wonders how the IDF can bombard villages in 
retaliation to pin-point attacks on its soldiers in Lebanon and then call the
Lebanese terrorists.

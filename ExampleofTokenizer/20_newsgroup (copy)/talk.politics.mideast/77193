To all the readers of talk.politics.mideast,alt.flame,alt.stupidity

I am posting this message on behalf of a staff member at UCDavis whose 
account had been broken into and used to post offensive messages to
all these groups.

	--Dave

----begin included message from szljubi@othello.ucdavis.edu


Please be advised that the person(s) sending to you the inflammatory
remarks you have been receiving have been doing so by ILLEGALLY accessing
my account.

Our campus Information Technology security group has cut off my account's
access to this hacker, and every effort is being made to track down this
person.

I apologize profusely that you have been subjected to the derogatory
comments made by this person and I detest that my name was attached to
them.

Thank you to those of you who alerted our campus security about the nature
of this problem.

Sincerely,
P. Ljubi

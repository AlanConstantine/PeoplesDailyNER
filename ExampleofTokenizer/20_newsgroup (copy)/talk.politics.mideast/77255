It is easy for Sen. Biden to say that when there are no US troops in
Zepa or Srebinica or Sarejevo...

The existing UN policy may certaining be wrong, but the US wants
to dictate policy, and make Europe responsible for the consequences
of that policy...

...Bosnia is a big enough problem for the US to preach about what
other countries should be doing with their forces...but its forces
are safely tucked away at home in the US.

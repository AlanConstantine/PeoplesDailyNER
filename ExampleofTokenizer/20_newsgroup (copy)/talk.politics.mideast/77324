DATELINE: PARIS

BODY:

     PARIS, April 16 (AFP) - An Egyptian man held police at bay
for several hours outside the Iranian Embassy here, threatening
to blow up the building to protest against terrorism and
fundamentalism.

      The man in his thirties, who was identified only as "an
Egyptian national ," displayed a banner outside the embassy
gate and said he was in possession of several sticks of dynamite
he threatened to set off.

      He later surrendeed quietly to police who had blocked off the
neighborhood, saying he wanted to attract media attention to
"the dangers of Islamic fundamentalism."

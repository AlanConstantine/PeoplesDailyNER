It seems to me that you are the one who is supposed to do some reading. I think
that our major difference in opinion is on the legitimacy of Sevres. First, thattreaty was signed by the Ottoman Empire therefore legally it does not bind the 
Republic of Turkey. The new independence movement (which by the way, is not the same as the Young Turks) naturally rejected it out of hand. to say that we 
should accept because the Germans did theirs is absurd. We saw what the cosequences of such harsh treaties were in Hitler. Second, the Sevres treaty was even 
worse than Versailles. It divided the Ottoman Empire in to several influence 
zones, had the capital occupied, the economy under Allied control, the army di
minished to nothing but a police force, in short a country in name only. I'd
wonder if you would like to live under such conditions. And for the record, I donot feel sorry for the soldiers killed in IZMIR harbour. Before evacuating the 
city, the Greek forces burned it down, so it serves them right.
As for being fooled by Allied promises, that too is your fault. You did not come to Anatolia just to enforce Sevres but to take part in the plunder  as well.

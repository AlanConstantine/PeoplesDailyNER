That doesn't answer my question:  Can you give a proof that it is an official
policy of any Israeli government to kill "neutral observers" or UN personel
or others like them?

I wasn't sure that your original statement was wrong and was prepared to
recieve proofs that you are right  (since I don't follow the events closely).
Your last response made me pretty damn sure that at least YOU can't give such
a proof,  and you made your original statement without much ground to put it
on.

Even if it's true (and in this case I'd take it without asking you to prove it)
it is still far from killing reporters.  Also whenever that happened I'll bet
it happened as individual actions by certain soldiers and not as a policy of
the government  (e.g. see the Hawara case where a colonel was sentenced for
giving orders to kick Arabs,  as far as I remember).

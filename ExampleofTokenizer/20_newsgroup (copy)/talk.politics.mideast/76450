	   Actually, You're wrong as well. The KKK is allowed to
   march and any attempts to curtail their freedom is rejected
   (Actually I believe the ACLU won a case for them last year). 
	   Morality should not be legilated in a free country like
   the U.S. 

Yes. That seems to be the problem. Even Germany now has laws for its
military where soldiers are *required* to disobey orders if they
believe the orders are morally incorrect.

Naziism is prohibited in Canada, Germany (others?). How pray tell is
Canda any less free than the US?

	   I'll post something on TJ and Uva under Uva for those
   Hoos bashers.

Harry.

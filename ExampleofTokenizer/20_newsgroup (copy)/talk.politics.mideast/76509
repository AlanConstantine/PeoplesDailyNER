Probably not--he's just singing someone else's opera. He's good, too; perhaps he should get "The Best Supporting Singer..."

I can give you a Q/A account that is well documented (just go back and reread some of the articles that appeared after this "joke"):

Q: How many antisemites does it take to come up with another anti-Israeli
   provocation on the net?

A: Just one. He'll fabricate a lie, and many more will applaud

I would much prefer if Mr. Steel would refrain from this kind of jokes in the 
future. They're not just offensive. They also have a very negative effect on 
the state of things between Jews and Arabs. So thanks for nothing, clown!

Mike.

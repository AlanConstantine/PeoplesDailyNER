I wonder if the seven Islamic fundamentalist who have just been sentenced
to death in Egypt would agree with this assessment of Islam.  Certainly they
don't feel like Jews have the right to practice Judaism in Israel.  Let's not
forget that during the Jordanian occupation (1948-1967) of the West Bank and Jerusalem,
Jews were not allowed into Jerusalem even to pray at the Western Wall (the most
holy site to Jews).


>Does Judaism permit freedom of religion
>(i.e. are non-Jews recognized in Judaism).  Just wondering.

What are you talking about?

First of all I'm still baffled what you possibly could have
found racist in my argument for freedom of speach. I did not
mention names, nationalities, countries let alone races. 
	You are right in that Virginia.edu does not have a
thought police like Israel.nysernet.org seems to. I didn't know
that you guys are getting a privelege by the Israelis by
getting "the means to speak publicly". Virginia.edu lets EVERY
student regardless of their opinion to speak their mind. 
	Virginia.edu is true to its founding father, Thomas
Jefferson the author of the bill of rights, in allowing freedom
of speach. Sorry you guys in israel have a hard time with the
concept.

Mr. Emmanuel Huna,

Give logic a break will you.  Gosh, what kind of intelligence do
you have, if any?


Tesiel says :  Be a man not an arab for once.
I say       :  Fuck of Tsiel (for saying the above).

I get tagged as a racist, and he gets praised?
Well Mr. logicless, Tsiel has apologized for his racist remark.
I praise him for that courage, but I tell Take a hike to whoever calls me
a racist without a proof because I am not.

You have proven to us that your brain has been malfunctioning
and you are just a moron that's loose on the net.

About being fanatic:  I am proud to be a fanatic about my rights and
freedom, you idiot.

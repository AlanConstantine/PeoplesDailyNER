	Hate to be simple minded about this Tim, but I think its
really very simple.  He was a dirty Jew.  And the only good Jew, in
some peoples mind, is a dead Jew.  Thats what 40 years of propaganda
that fails to discriminate between Jew and Zionist will do.  Thats
what 20 years of statements like the ones I've appended will do to
someones mind.  They make people sick.  They drag down political
discourse to the point where killing your opponent is an honorable way
to resolve a dispute.

	What else can come of such demagogery?  Peace?

Arafat on political pluralism:

	``Any Palestinian leader who suggests ending the intifada
	exposes himself to the bullets of his own people and
	endangers his life.  The PLO will know how to deal with
	him.''
	--- Arafat, Kuwaiti News Agency, 1/2/89

Arafat on the massacre at Tienamin Square:

	``...  on behalf of the Arab Palestinian People, their
        leadership, and myself...  [I] take this opportunity to express
        extreme gratification that you were able to restore normal order
        after the recent incidents in People's China.''
	--- Arafat in telegram sent to the head of the Chinese Communist Party

Yassir Arafat, humanitarian:

       ``Open fire on the new Jewish immigrants ...  be they from the
       Soviet Union, Ethiopia, or anywhere else.  It would be a disgrace if
       we did not lift a finger while herds of immigrants settle our
       territory.  I want you to shoot...  It makes no difference if they
       live in Jaffa or Jericho.  I give you explicit orders to open fire.
       Do everything to stop the flow of immigration.''
	--- Yassir Arafat, Al Muharar (Lebanese weekly), April 10, 1990

Yassir Arafat on genocide:

	``When the Arabs set off their volcano, there will only be Arabs in
	this part of the world.  Our people will continue to fuel the torch
	of the revolution with rivers of blood until the whole of the
	occupied homeland is liberated...''
	--- Yasser Arafat, AP, 3/12/79

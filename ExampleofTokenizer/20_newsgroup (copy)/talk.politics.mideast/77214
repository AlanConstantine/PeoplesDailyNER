Ethiopian Jews and not-quite Jews

The Israeli press has published items about Ethiopian 
Jews waiting in camps in Addis Ababa for immigration to 
Israel, who are dying of starvation. The following are 
excerpts from an interview with the former general 
director of the JDC project for development and welfare 
of Ethiopian Jews, Kobi Friedman (Hadashot, 21 April 
1993), who has stated that "there are people dying in 
Addis Ababa, but they are converts to Christianity":

"Hadashor published the item about the dying Jews after 
viewing a video tape filmed last week in Adis Ababa. 
How do you know that they are actually converts to 
Chritianity ?

"If there are Jews on the tape, then I don't know what to 
say. I am speaking from experience when I say that those 
who remained in Ethiopia are Christians. I know that 
there have previously been things published in the press 
by interesting parties, and there is no connection 
between them and reality."

"What interested parties ?"

"Ethiopian immigrants who want their Christian relatives 
to come here."

"What to you recommend that Ethiopian children in Israel 
do, when their parents and the rest of their relatives 
remain in Ethiopia ?"

"I ask if it is the job of the State of Israel to bring in the 
40 relatives who stayed in Ethiopia. Well, my answer is 
that it is not. It would be a better solution, economically 
as well, for that young man to buy a one-way ticket to 
Ethiopia and reunite with his family there."

                An Appeal to Mankind

During the last three years Azerbaijan and its multinational
population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of
the Soviet Union. All humanitarian, constitutional human rights
guaranteed by the UN Charter, Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, Helsinki Agreements, Human Problems International Forums,
documents signed by the Soviet Union - all of them are violated.

The USSR's President, government bodies do not defend Azerbaijan
though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to
guarantee life and peace.

The 140,000 strong army of Armenian terrorists with Moscow's
tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against
Azerbaijan. As a result, a part of Azerbaijan has been occupied
and annexed, hundreds of people killed, thousands wounded.

Some 200,000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly
deported from the Armenian SSR, their historical homeland.
Together with them 64,000 Russians and 22,000 Kurds have also
been driven out, a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan.
Some 40,000 Turkish-Meskhetians, Lezghins and representatives 
of other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the Central
Asia where the President and government bodies did not guarantee
them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations.

One of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against
Azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the
Armenian extremists' destruction of the Karabakh scientific
experimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection 
of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR.

We beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance,
for the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis are
violated, its territory, culture  and history are trampled,
its people are shot. There is persistent negative image of
Azerbaijanians abroad, and this defamation is spread over 
the whole world by Soviet mass media, Armenian lobby in the
USSR and the United States. 

One of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and
generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance
while the truth is that all these shootings and recent 
events stem from the territorial claims of Armenia on
Azerbaijan.

It is a well documented fact that before the conflict there
were no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on the
issue of Karabakh. Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly
and calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land, had their
representatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan
SSR.

We are for a united, indivisible, sovereign Azerbaijan, we 
are for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one
of the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic 
Republic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade.

But all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the
Soviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists
encouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '1,000
Year Reich' - the 'Great Armenia' - by annexing the 
neighboring lands.

The world public opinion shed tears to save the whales,
suffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent.

But what about the lives of seven million human beings?
If these people are Muslims, does it mean that they are
less valuable? Can people be discriminated by their 
colour of skin or religion, by their residence or other
attributes?

All people are brothers, and we appeal to our brothers
for help and understanding. This is not the first appeal
of Azerbaijan to the world public opinion. Our previous
appeals were unheard. However, we still carry the hope
that the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propaganda
will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and
stimulate at least as much help and compassion for
Azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins.

But perhaps Turkiye should intervene in the affairs of the Caucasus
in the name of peace and democracy. The Armenians are Christians, the
Azerbaijanis are Moslems, and Islam is a religion especially unloved
by the democrat-westernizers. Besides, at the root of this conflict
lie the territorial claims on Azerbaijan, a consequence of which
were the blood and suffering of innocent Azeri people, hundreds of
thousands of refugees, and gross violations of human rights. 

Recently Armenians attacked the Azeri town of Khojaly and massacred
thousands of Azeris. The Paris-based 'Association for Democracy and
Human Rights in Azerbaijan' puts the number of Khojali victims
at 3,145. Some of the dead were scalped and mutilated. This whole
thing has now gone entirely too far.

They already did. The scenario and genocide staged by the Armenians 
78 years ago in the Ottoman Empire is being reenacted again - this 
time in Azerbaijan. There are remarkable similarities between the 
plots, the perpetrators, and the underdogs.

                    MASSACRE BY ARMENIANS BEING REPORTED

     Agdam,Azerbaijan,March 2 (Reuters) - Fresh evidence emerged today 
of a massacre of civilians by Armenian militants in Nagorno-Karabakh, 
a predominantly Armenian enclave of Azerbaijan.
     The republic of Armenia reiterated denials that its militants had killed
1,000 people in the Azerbaijani populated town of Khojaly last week and 
massacred men, women and children fleeing the carnage across snow-covered
mountain passes.
     But dozen of bodies scattered over the area lent credence to Azerbaijani
reports of a massacre.

                         Scalping Reported
     Azerbaijani officials and journalists who flew briefly to the region
by helicopter brought back three dead children with the back of their
heads blown off. They said shooting by Armenians has prevented them 
from retrieving more bodies.
     "Women and children have been scalped," said Assad Faradshev, an aide
to Nagorno-Karabakh's Azerbaijani Governor. "When we began to pick up bodies,
they began firing at us."
     The Azerbaijani militia chief in Agdam, Rashid Mamedov, said: "The bodies
are lying there like flocks of sheep. Even the fascists did nothing like this."
                         
                         Truckloads of Bodies
     Near Agdam on the outskirts of Nagorno-Karabakh, a Reuters photographer,
Frederique Lengaigne, said she had seen two trucks filled with Azerbaijani
bodies.
     "In the first one I counted 35, and it looked as though there were as
many in the second," she said. "Some had their head cut off, and many had
been burned. They were all men, and a few had been wearing khaki uniforms.

If a landlord sells an apartment building "vacant" to another landlord
and fails to notify his tenants, they just might find themselves out
on the street all of a sudden.  The seller may be a scoundrel and a
crook but this doesn't make the buyer a "thief", as Israelis are so
often called here on tpm.

The Arabs that lived along the coast in Western Palestine, later to be
called Israel, were shafted by their brother Arabs just as they've
been shafted for decades since then by their Arab bretheren.  Somehow,
though, the Arab call has continued to blame Israel, not only for the
Syrian landowner sell-out in Western Palestine (Israel) but even for
the occupation of Eastern Palestine (Jordan) by the Hashemites.  This
is just more of refusing to take blame for one's own actions.

If your job was eliminated in a corporate takeover, you could probably
go to court, too.  You'd probably lose, though.

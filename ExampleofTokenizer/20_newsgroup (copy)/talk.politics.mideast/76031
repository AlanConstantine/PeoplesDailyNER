Henrik (?),

Your ignorance manifests itself in an awkward form of intransigence. I'm not
going to spend time to review with you the recent history of Cyprus. If you are
really interested, I can provide you with a number of references on the issue.
Just send me EMail for that.

Relax! You're swinging fists into open air... I was *agreeing* with you,
assuming that would be one of your points that you did not state! You may 
not be very much used to it, to be agreed with - that is, but take it more
easily.  !:-)

No, Henrik, believe me: You don't hope that.

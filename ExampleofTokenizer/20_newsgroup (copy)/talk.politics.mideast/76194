Don't worry, Danny, every blatantly violent and abusive posting made by 
Hamzah is immediately forwarded to the operator of the system in which he 
has an account.  I'd imagine they have quite a file started on this 
fruitcake--and have already indicated that they have rules governing 
racist and threatening use of their resources.  I'd imagine he'll be out 
of our hair in a short while.

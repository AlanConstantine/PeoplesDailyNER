I always like your kind of odds. The Greek governments must be held 
to account for the sub-human conditions of the Turkish minority living 
in the Western Thrace under the brutal Greek domination. The religious 
persecution, cultural oppression and economical ex-communication applied 
to the Turkish population in that area are the dimensions of the human 
rights abuse widespread in Greece.

"Greece's Housing Policies Worry Western Thrace Turks"

...Newly built houses belonging to members of the minority
community in Dedeagac province, had, he said, been destroyed
by Evros province public works department on Dec. 4.

Sungar added that they had received harsh treatment by the
security forces during the demolition.

"This is not the first demolition in Dedeagac province; more
than 40 houses were destroyed there between 1979-1984 and 
members of that minority community were made homeless," he
continued. 

"Greece Government Rail-Roads Two Turkish Ethnic Deputies"

While World Human Rights Organizations Scream, Greeks 
Persistently Work on Removing the Parliamentary Immunity
of Dr. Sadik Ahmet and Mr. Ahmet Faikoglu.

In his 65-page confession, Salman Demirok, a former chief of PKK
operations in Hakkari confessed that high-level relations between
PKK, Greece and Greek Cypriot administration existed.

According to Demirok, Greek Cypriot administration not only 
gives shelter to PKK guerillas but also supplies them with 
food and weapons at the temporary camps set up in its territory. 
Demirok disclosed that PKK has three safe houses in South Cyprus, 
used by terrorists such as Ferhat. In the camps, he added, 
terrorists were trained to use various weapons including RPG's 
and anti-aircraft guns which had been purchased directly from 
the Greek government. Greek Cypriot government has gone to the 
extent of issuing special identification cards to PKK members so 
that they can travel from one region to another without being 
confronted by legal obstacles. Demirok's account was confirmed 
by another PKK defector, Fatih Tan, who gave himself over to 
police in Hakkari after spending four years with PKK. Tan explained
that the terrorists went through a training in camps in South Cyprus, 
sometimes for a period of 12 weeks or more.

         "Torture in Greece: Hidden Reality"

by falanga (beating on the soles of the feet), electric shocks,
and was threatened with being thrown out of the window. An 
official medical report clearly documented this torture....

Case 2: Horst Bosniatzki, a West German Citizen.

...At midnight he was taken to the beach, chains were put to his 
feet and he was threatened to be thrown to the sea. He was dragged
along the beach for about a 1.5 Km while being punched on the 
head and kidneys...Back on the police station, he was beaten
on the finger tips with a thin stick until one of the fingertips
split open....

              "Abu Nidal's Advisers" Reportedly Training
                  "PKK & ASALA Militants" in Cyprus

       Nicosia, Ankara,  Tel Aviv. The Israeli  secret service,
       Mossad,  is   reported  to  have   acquired  significant
       information in connection  with the camps set  up in the
       Troodos  mountains   in  Cyprus  for  the   training  of
       militants of the PKK and ASALA {Armenian Secret Army for
       the Liberation  of Armenia}. According to  sources close
       to Mossad, about 700 Kurdish, Greek Cypriot and Armenian
       militants  are   undergoing  training  in   the  Troodos
       mountains in  southern Cyprus.  The same  sources stated
       that Abu  Nidal's special  advisers are  giving military
       training to  the PKK and  ASALA militants in  the camps.
       They added that the  militants leave southern Cyprus for
       Libya, Lebanon, Syria, Greece  and Iran after completing
       their training.  Mossad has established that  due to the
       clashes  which were  taking  place  among the  terrorist
       groups based  in Syria, the PKK  and ASALA organisations
       moved to  the Greek Cypriot  part of Cyprus,  where they
       would  be  more  comfortable. They  also  transferred  a
       number of  their camps in  northern Syria to the Troodos
       mountains.

       Mossad  revealed that  the  Armenian National  Movement,
       which is known as the MNA, has opened liaison offices in
       Nicosia, Athens and  Tripoli in order to  meet the needs
       of the  camps. The offices are used to provide  material
       support for the  Armenian  camps. Meanwhile, the  leader
       of the  Popular Front for  the Liberation of  Palestine,
       George  Habash, is  reported  to  have ordered  his  men
       not  to   participate  in  the  operations  carried  out
       by  the  PKK &  ASALA, which  he  described  as "extreme
       racist,  extreme  nationalist  and   fascist."  Reliable
       sources have said that  Habash believed that  the recent
       operations carried  out by the PKK  militants  show that
       organisation  to  be a  band  of  irregulars  engaged in
       extreme  nationalist  operations.  They  added  that  he
       instructed  his militants  to sever their links with the
       PKK  and avoid clashing with it. It has been established
       that George Habash  expelled ASALA  militants  from  his
       camp  after ASALA's  connections  with  drug trafficking
       were exposed.

                    Special to The New York Times

ATHENS, June 26 - A dispute developed today between Athens and 
Washington over United States intelligence reports saying that 
Athens, for several months, conducted negotiations with the
terrorist known as Abu Nidal...

They said the contacts were verified in what were termed hard
intelligence reports.

Abu Nidal leads the Palestinian splinter group Al Fatah 
Revolutionary Council, implicated in the 1985 airport 
bombings at Rome and Vienna that contributed to the Reagan 
Administration's decision to bomb Tripoli, Libya, last year.

In Washington, State Department officials said that when
Administration officials learned about the contacts, the
State Department drafted a strongly worded demarche. The
officials also expressed unhappiness with Greece's dealings
with ASALA, the Armenian Liberation Army, which has carried
out terrorist acts against Turks....

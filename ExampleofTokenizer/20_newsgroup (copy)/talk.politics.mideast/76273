Hamza answers one of my articles:

[TO] If indeed Israeli soldiers killed a "Hamas Mujahid" with an anti-tank
[TO] missile then I'm almost sure that the "terrorist zionists" would not
[TO] have been able to cut up a body which was probably desintegrated by the
[TO] missile.

[Hamza] maybe the missile didn't hit directly such that his body
[Hamza] gets "desintegrated."  of course, destroying 10 houses to
[Hamza] kill someone is not a surgical operation, or is it?

Well done Hamza. You edited my answer to Anas Omran, took everything out
of context and then replied to it the way you wanted.
Now I really understand why the peace process is not making any progress.

You guys ain't listening, just babbling away to your same old rhetoric.

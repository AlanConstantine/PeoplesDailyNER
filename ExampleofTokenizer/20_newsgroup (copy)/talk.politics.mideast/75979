	And all this time I thought it was the US & Britian invading
Normandy, the constant, round the clock bombing, and the fact that the
Germans were fighting on two fronts.  How silly of me.  :)

	This is not to devalue the actions of the resistance
movements, but resistance movements did not defeat the Nazis.

	Israel has repeatedly stated that it will leave when the
Lebanese government shows that it can prevent attacks on Israel, and
when the Syrians agree to leave.

	The Lebanese have not tried diplomacy for very long, or maybe
they're not capable of getting rid of the Syrians and Iranians who
occupy their land.  If they closed down the Hezbolah, and negotiated a
withdrawl of Syrian forces, Israel would be happy to leave.

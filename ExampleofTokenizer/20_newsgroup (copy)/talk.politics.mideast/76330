This has been discussed before, by several people, on this net.  The
statement is attributable either to Hajj Amin al-Husseini, former Grand
Mufti of Jerusalem - and the leader of the Palestinian death squads
during the 1948 war, or to one of his chief henchmen.  

It was not coined by B'nai B'rith or, for that matter, any Jewish
organization.

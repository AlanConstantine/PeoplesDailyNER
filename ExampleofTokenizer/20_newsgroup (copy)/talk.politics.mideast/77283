Macedonia said yesterday it had neither requested or needs such
forces.  

This is sort of like sending the National Guard to Bel Air when
the riot is in South Central!

Obviously, Clinton is again trying to make policy for image purposes
in America rather than to try to deal with the real problem and
assume a share of responsibility for the problem.  He obviously
didn't even consult with the Macedonians...he was just looking at
the map of the former Yugoslavia for the safest place to put 
American troops so he could say to the Europeans...hey, look, we
have troops on the ground in the former Yugoslavia too...now let
me bomb so I can make it look like I am doing something in the
American media. 

The problem is that the blue berets in Bosnia are dead meat if
Clinton starts bombing, but Clinton doesn't have the courage to
ask that the blue berets leave, because then he becomes primarily
responsible to the Bosnian policy of the UN and the allies.
Clinton wants to have his cake and eat it too...he wants to feel
free to use American military power for the sake of domestic
US politics and his domestic image, but he doesn't want to assume
the primary international leadership role in the UN and among
the allies, like Bush, for all his faults, did in the Gulf War...
because with leadership comes responsibility, and Clinton seems
to want to retain the Europeans as scapegoats.

Clinton wants to leave the Europeans in charge and responsible,
but wants to freelance on the side...and if his freelancing gets
too hot, he wants to be able to cut and run...the American public may
be easily fooled...European leaders aren't.

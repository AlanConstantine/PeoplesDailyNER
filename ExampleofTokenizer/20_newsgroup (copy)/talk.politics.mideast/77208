# This issue has been going on for a while and your presentation here of

  Tim, you're missing the big sleight-of-hand here.  I can accept every
  word quoted from Halabi and still have ZERO evidence of any mosques
  being razed.  Note that what Halabi refers to is not that mosques
  were razed but that people PROTESTED alleged razing.  Too well we
  know that this is a common demagogic tactic (or has anyone forgotten
  the Temple Mount riots, when the Moslem crowd was led to believe
  that the Israeli Guards were there to cover for the TMF instead of
  stop them?)

What is this "Gaza"? Are you purposely separating it from the "West Bank"?
If so, why separate the people and territories? If not, why are you just
addressing "Gaza" here?

By all means, continue to list the "etc." The reason I particularly
bring this up here is that there are **many** from middle eastern
and west asian countries. That fact in itself **adds** an important
element to any consideration of "resolution" of the Arab-Israel
conflict.

You explained what "sea" meant with regard to the Israelis/jews,
please do so in this case.

"Just"? You better not ask for that because that would mean North 
American tribes would be returned their lands, the pre-Islamic tribes 
would take back their lands from the Islamic invaders, the Saxons get 
to kick the Normans out of the UK, the central and south american 
tribes get to kick the spanish descendents out of thier lands..... 
And, once we have returned the land to those who last possessed it, 
we have to find out from whom **they** stole it. At some point, *every* 
culture stole the land they are on from previous occupants.

But wait! Now you refer to "Palestinians", so what happened to "Gaza"?

>I personnaly opt for the third alternative. How about you folks ?

As we both know, most people would choose the third alternative. And,
since you have done so in the past, perhaps you would initiate things by 
presenting your vision of "resolution". In doing so, however, the worries
(not paranioas, *worries*) and resonable expectations **of both**
parties should be considered.

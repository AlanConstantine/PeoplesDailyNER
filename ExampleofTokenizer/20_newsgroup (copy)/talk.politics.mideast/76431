	   Well canada is wrong. If it was in the US the ACLU would have
   made sure that such repressive laws are found unconstitutional.
   Do you think the Church didn't find Galileo's perception of the
   universe offensive.


Bull shit. There is no reason in the world why we can't say that
taking views analogous to the KKK's or some such organization is
wrong. There is no reason why some morality may not be legislated. As
it is we do not allow theft, or murder, or rape. Why should we allow
hateful sppech whose only purpose is to stir anger and violence.

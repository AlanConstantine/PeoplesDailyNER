I didnot know that "Master of wisdom" can be "name clling" too,

First, my above statement doesnot say that "the existence of israeli citizens
in the WB revoke their right of life" but it says "the israeli occupation
of the WB revoke the right of life for some/most its citizens - basically
revokes the right of for its military men". Clearly, occupation is an
undeclared war; during war, attacks against military targets are fully legitimate. 

Secondly, surely israeli have human rights, but they ask their goverment to
protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories, not by further oppressing
Palestinean human rights.

Because not all states are like Israel, as oppressive, as ignorant, or as tyrant.

So you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human rights.
(i am understanding this from your first statement in this paragraph).

Exactly, you are right. I guess that the problem is that the israeli goverment 
is full with  men like Joseph Weitz.

Above you wrote that you understood what i meant (underlined by ^ ): 
any system can be used to solve the conflict , but not any system would 
resolve it JUSTLY.

|> Guess where that takes your logic? To never-never land. 

You are proving yourself as a " ". First you understood what i meant, but then
you claim you didnot so to claim a contradiction in my logic. Too bad for you, 
the Master of Wisdom.

Why do you feel ashamed by things and facts that you believe in , if you were a
Zionists. If you believe in Zionist codes and acts, well i feel sorry for you,
because the same Rabbi Shoham had said "Yes, Zionism is racism".
If you feel ashamed and bothered by the Zionist codes, then drop Zionism.
If you are not Zionist, why are you bothered then. You should join me in
condemning these racist Zionist codes and acts.

That is the result of living in an alternate universe with 'Arromdians'
of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle. Are you '*ians'
for real?

 district, was now cut off and a large number of wounded were left stranded.

 the attack on the village... Tass also said shells fired from Armenian 
 villages into the Azeri populated town of Susha, just 6 miles south of

"Elif Kaban, a Reuter correspondent in Agdam, reported that after a battle 
 on Wednesday, Azeris were burying scores of people who died when Armenians 
 overran the town of Khojaly, the second-biggest Azeri settlement in the 
 area. 'The world is turning its back on what's happening here. We are dying 
 and you are just watching,' one mourner shouted at a group of journalists."

Armenian Soldiers Massacre Hundreds of Fleeing Families:

"The attackers killed most of the soldiers and volunteers defending the 
 women and children.  They then turned their guns on the terrified refugees.  
 The few survivors later described what happened: 'That's when the real 
 slaughter began,' said Azer Hajiev, one of the three soldiers to survive.  
 'The Armenians just shot and shot. And they came in and started carving 
 up people with their bayonets and knives.'  A 45-year-old man who had been 
 shot in the back  said:' We were walking through the brush. Then they opened 
 up on us and people were falling all around.  My wife fell, then my child."

 'Women and children had been scalped,' said Assad Faradzev, an aide to 
 Karabagh's Azeri governor.  Azeri television showed pictures of one 
 truckload of bodies brought to the Azeri town of Agdam, some with their 
 faces apparently scratched with knives or their eyes gouged out."

Bodies Mark Site of Karabagh Massacre:

"A local truce was enforced to allow the Azerbaijanis to collect their dead 
 and any refugees still hiding in the hills and forest.  All are the bodies 
 of ordinary people, dressed in the poor, ugly clorhing of workers. Of the 31 
 we saw only one policeman and two apparent national volunteers were wearing 
 uniform.  All the rest were civilians, including eight women and three small
 children. Two groups, apparently families, had fallen together, the children 
 cradled in the women's arms.  Several of them, including one small girl, had 
 terrible head injuries: only her face was left. Survivors have told how they 
 saw Armenians shooting them point blank as they lay on the ground."

Karabagh Survivors Flee to Mountains:

"Geyush Gassanov, the deputy mayor of Khocaly, said that Armenian troops 
 surrounded the town after 7 pm on Tuesday. They were accompanied by six 
 or seven light tanks and armoured carriers.  'We thought they would just 
 bombard the village, as they had in the past, and then retreat.  But they 
 attacked, and our defence force couldn't do anything against their tanks.'  
 Other survivors described how they had been fired on repeatedly on their 
 way through the mountains to safety. 'For two days we crawled most of the 
 way to avoid gunfire,' Sukru Aslanov said.  His daughter was killed in the 
 battle for Khodjaly, and his brother and son died on the road."

Corpses Litter Hills in Karabagh:

"As we swooped low over the snow covered hills of Nagorno-Karabagh we saw 
 the scattered corpses. Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as 
 they ran...Suddenly there was a thump...[our Azerbaijani helicopter] had 
 been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post..."
 Anatol Lieven
 The Times (London), 3/4/92

"Police in western Azerbaijan said they had recovered the bodies of 
 120 Azerbaijanis killed as they fled an Armenian assault in the 
 disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabagh and said they were blocked from 
 recovering more bodies."
 The Wall Street Journal, 3/4/92

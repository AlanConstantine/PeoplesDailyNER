Well Bosnia and the US did...the UN cannot impose blue berets on
a country, and the US has voted for the current policy and mandate
in the Security Council...and could have said no if it wanted to...
it has a veto.

Clinton has not demanded the removal of the UN forces...because he want
to have his cake and eat it too...he wants to dictate policy but
not be responsible for the policy he wants to dictate.  If Clinton
asks for the blue berets to leave, then he Bill Clinton becomes
responsible for what happens...him and Sen. Biden and their friends
who want to fight the war from 10,000 ft...as long as the blue berets
are there Clinton can use Europe as a scapegoat for American
indecisiveness.

I fully admit that the current UN policy approved by all the major
powers including the US may be wrong or inappropriate...but these
"back-seat drivers" in the US like Clinton and Biden are just a bunch
of hypocrites looking for an gimmick to look like they are doing 
something to assuage their own consciences and those who are
demanding action or leadership...and most European leaders are
smart enough to know the difference between American hot air and
American leadership.

Well, if Biden is so outraged...why the hell doesn't he do something
about it...where is his resolution in the US Senate for a declaration
of war or the commitment of US forces and troops.  Biden is just
full of hot air.

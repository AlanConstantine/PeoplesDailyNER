It is the Croats that were divided, at least 70,000 were left in Serbian
province of Vojvodina. It is the Muslims that were divided, 200,000
left in the region of Sanjak that now belongs to Serbia. If the Serbs
in Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina want self-determination, the same
right should be given to Croats and Muslims, and Albanians and Hungarians
in Serbia. Why should Serbia be exempted?

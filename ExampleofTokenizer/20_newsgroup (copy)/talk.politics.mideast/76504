I see that our retarded translator, David, is still writing things that
don't make sense. Hey David I can see where you are.. May be one day,
We will have the chance to talk deeply about that freedom of speach of
yours.. And you now, killing or torture, these things are only easy
ways out.. I have different plans for you and all empty headeds like 
you...

Lets get serious, DAVE, don't ever write bad things about Turkish people
or especially Cyprus.. If I hear a word from you again that I consider
to be a curse to my people I will retalliate...

Muccccukkk..
TIMUCIN.

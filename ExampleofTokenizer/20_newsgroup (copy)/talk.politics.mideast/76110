HELLO, shit face david, I see that you are still around. I dont want to 
see your shitty writings posted here man. I told you. You are getting
itchy as your fucking country. Hey , and dont give me that freedom
of speach bullshit once more. Because your freedom has ended when you started
writing things about my people. And try to translate this "ebenin donu
butti kafa David.".

BYE, ANACIM HADE.

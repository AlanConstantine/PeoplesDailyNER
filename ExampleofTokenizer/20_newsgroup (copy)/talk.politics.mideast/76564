  Does this mean that YOU are volunteering to wade through the
  Mutlu/Argic deluge that comes in every day?  Some of us are
  tired of being dragged into content-free pissing contests
  with reflexive bigots.  We INTENSELY dislike being stuck between
  letting this crap pass without comment as though it were
  unremarkable and replying to it and getting sucked in again.

  Let's keep some perspective here.

  IMHO, the Josh's policy of forwarding the garbage in question,
  without comment, to the relevant sysadmin strikes a good
  balance.  The stuff was, after all, PUBLISHED on a public
  forum -- from that very site, yet.  Hardly a matter of
  confidentiality or copyright.  If the local administration
  wants to do something about it, they have that right.  If
  not, nobody's twisting their arms.

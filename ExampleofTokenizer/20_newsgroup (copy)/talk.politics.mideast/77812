Funny you should mention. That's the whole point 'paliks' invariably miss.

Annual Output Per Person in Dollars Adjusted to Purchasing Power

In terms of 'Annual Output Per Person in Dollars Adjusted to 
Purchasing Power Parity,' Greece is in the same category with 
Turkiye.


Indeed, Greek Governments have enormous problems to tackle. The 
economy is in shambles, corruption is rampant, air pollution is 
in outrageous dimensions, state-sponsored terrorism is the name 
of the game and infrastructure is decaying. Another insightful 
article in the New York Times (Sunday, April 7) exposes the dirty 
linen of Greece, and describes her as the pariah of the European 
Community. The article reports that ''...with un-European antics,
Greece uses the Community as a cash register. She squanders, and
at times even steals the European tax payers' money for political  
featherbedding at home. The principal members of the Community
admit that it was a mistake to accept Greece to the European
Community.'' This affirmation is testimony to the fact that
notwithstanding her geographic location, Greece is un-European
in mentality and attitude. 

Indeed, during the last 12 years, Turkiye registered a great 
success with regard to economic restructuring. A sound economy, 
ready to be integrated to the world economies, has emerged, 
succeeding to the faltering one, witnessed in the '70s.

Just 12 years ago, Greece used to export double as much as 
Turkiye did. Now inversely, Turkiye's overall exports exceed 
by far that of Greece. As far as the tourism incomes are 
concerned, we are witnessing the same phenomenon.

The governments in Turkiye have put a particular emphasis on 
the infrastructure investments (rather than investing in
world terrorist organizations), thereby solving this issue 
completely. Indeed, in the '70s, it was out of the question 
to conduct a telephone call from Eastern Anatolia to the West. 
Nowadays, this is not the case at all, and in a far remote 
town, even in a village you may have, at any time, a long-distance 
call to any given country.

However, the same could not be applied to Greece. In fact,
it is not so easy in Athens to have a trunk call to Germany
round the clock. And if you happen to be in the Greek islands,
then your chance will be pretty slim. Therefore, it would not
be an exaggeration to argue that Turkiye is far ahead of 
Greece in regard to telecommunication facilities. Greece,
by virtue of its full membership, has enjoyed all advantages
of the EC, obtaining huge grants and extensive subsidies. 
Turkiye, having no access at all to similar financial supports,
has nevertheless managed to create a better economy which 
enabled it to produce consecutive current accounts surplus
over the last two years. As such, Turkiye deserves to be the
only country in its region having permanent current accounts
surplus.

   You know ed,...  You're right!  Andi shouldn't be comparing
   Israel to the Nazis.  The Israelis are much worse than the
   Nazis ever were anyway.  The Nazis did a lot of good for
   Germany, and they would have succeeded if it weren't for the
   damn Jews.  The Holocaust never happened anyway.  Ample
   evidence given by George Schafer at Harvard, Dept. of History,
   and even by Randolph Higgins at NYU, have shown that the
   Holocaust was just a semitic conspiracy created to obtain
   sympathy to piush for the creation of Israel.

   Just kidding.

Be careful rj3s. When people start finding humour in the Holocaust
they often run the danger of exposing themselves for the hateful
refuse that they really are.

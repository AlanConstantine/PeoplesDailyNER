There are doubts about it. Why don't you define what self-hating Jew means?
I found the idea itself of being a self-hating Jew to be one of those
rediculous things that people repeat and repeat because it seems to have a
meaning when in fact it has none.
I hope you can come up with a definition in itself and not something like:
look at this person, that is a self-hating Jew.

That is why I get moved when I see the Israeli Army killing people in 
the Occupied Territories as much as I get moved when I see a Plestinian
stabing people in Israel.

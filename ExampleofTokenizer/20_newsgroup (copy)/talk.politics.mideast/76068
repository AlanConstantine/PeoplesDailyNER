 	Attacking? Who is attacking who? Even the country you live in,USA, have condemned
	Armenia for it's attacking. And you start to say that the attackers
	are the Azeris?????
 	
	|>Armenians have lived in Nagorno Karabakh ever since there were Armenians

	?????
	Azeris have lived in Nagorno Karabakh ever since there were Azeris...
	Don't come with nonsence, there is no reason to attack a people
	just because a man called "Gorbatjov and co." gave the "freedom" to the people
	in this area.

	It's easy for people like you to blame history. The were a lot of 
        Indians living in USA. There is no reason for these 
	Indians to attack the "American"
	people and say:"It was the fault of the government of Germany and Great 
	Britain, because they made people come to our place......" Armenians lived in
	harmony with the Azeris until "Gorbatjov and co." gave "freedom" to the people
	in Karabag, then the Armenians started to kill, rape and torture the Azeris, not only
	in Karabag but also noe in Azerbadjan....

|>henrik]  However, I hope that the Armenians WILL force a TURKISH airplane
|>henrik]  to LAND for purposes of SEARCHING for ARMS similar to the one
|>henrik]  that happened last SUMMER. Turkey searched an AMERICAN plane
|>henrik]  (carrying humanitarian aid) bound to ARMENIA.



|>HE]     Don't speak about things you don't know: 8 U.S. Cargo planes
|>HE]     were heading to Armenia. When the Turkish authorities
|>HE]     announced that they were going to search these cargo
|>HE]     planes 3 of these planes returned to it's base in Germany.
|>HE]     5 of these planes were searched in Turkey. The content of
|>HE]     of the other 3 planes? Not hard to guess, is it? It was sure not
|>HE]     humanitarian aid.....


|>What story are you talking about? Planes from the U.S. have been sending

|>the 3 planes in your story, I would like to find out.



|>HE]     Search Turkish planes? You don't know what you are talking about.
|>HE]     Turkey's government has announced that it's giving weapons
|>HE]     to Azerbadjan since Armenia started to attack Azerbadjan
|>HE]     it self, not the Karabag province. So why search a plane for weapons
|>HE]     since it's content is announced to be weapons?

	|>It's too bad you would want Turkey to start a war with Armenia.	
 		
	  That's what i don't want, you couldn't imagine the result of a war.....
	  So France, Greece and  USA wants to start fighting with Azerbadjan???? 
	  They give a lot more weapons to the Armenians without 
	  saying it, that's no secret any more......


	  I must say that these Armenian Government is very shortsighted.
	  Do they think that they shall move from it's neigbours when the war
 	  is over???? The neighbour around will be there and Armenia must 	 
	  live in harmony with these if they don't want a "stone-age" country,
	  for that's what's will happen Armenia if the wars continues.
	
	  Look, The President of Turkey, Turgut Ozal, died and  Petrosyan
	  the Armenian Presindent is now in Turkey for the funeral. Is it because
	  he liked him? Sure NOT, because Armenia needs it's neighbours and must
	  live with these. But Armenia can't stop this war with continued ordertaking
	  from states like France and USA. With other words, if you love your people
	  you must think twice.....

	  And i wonder, "Shoot down turkish planes" WITH WHAT????? ohhh i forgot
	  the Armenians can't find food but there are a lot of arms from the mentioned
	  countries.....

Which was my point. By converting to another religion I do not loose
my cultural identity, I just loose my religious identification.
I consider that defining the belonging to a nation that claims the 
right to have a State based on religious belief is a form of racism.

To be a part or not of the Jeish Nation is defined by my culture and not
by my religion. Actually, if I am an atheist, which is in fact like 
converting into a non-Jewish in terms of religion, I am still considered as
part of the Jewish Nation.
I can be proud of my Jewish culture while not giving any importance to the
Jewish religion. Or, even more, I can be proud of my Jewish culture while
still be convinced that the real god is another one.
I do not know anyone who lost his memebership to the American nation 
because he changed of god.

I still believe that we should never confusse the actions of States with
the individuals who happen to live there.
In the same way that I do not think it is right to blame all Israelis for the
human rights violations of Israel, I do not think that we should assume
that all Arabs are guilty of the actions of the Arab States.
Some people fled their homes because they were scared. Now they are in
there, still suffering for what they are not responsible.
And, remember that we also were told the same at some point. We ended in
the diaspora. And, of course, I am not for doing to others what I did not
want done to me.

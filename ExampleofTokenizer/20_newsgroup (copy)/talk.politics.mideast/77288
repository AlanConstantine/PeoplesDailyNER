My reference is a 4 page essay in our local Star Tribute newspaper
putting the whole conflict in perspective. I will readily admit
that I am no authority in this area; however, other posteers 
asserted that *some* Muslims did join hands with Croats and
Nazis in persecuting Serbs. In any case, past actions do not
in any way validate or legitimize what is happending there now.

I sincerely do apologize to the extent the author of the essay
was wrong in making the assertion he made. 

Maybe, some student of history may put this in perspective.

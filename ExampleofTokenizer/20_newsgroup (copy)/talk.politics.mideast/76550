I am replying to this because I haven't seen anyone else do so yet. It
seems rather odd really as there are so few really wierd posters left
who aren't fascists or Arab extremists.

>Arab civilians did die at Dir yassin. But there was no massacre.

Yes it was and it was clearly admitted so by the troops who carried it
out and then stupidly deposited testimony in their own archives to that
effect.

Source? Noone is claiming this anymore except you. Would you like
to name one credible historian who asserts this? I believe that
even Begin has the decency not to claim this.

>and Stern fighters had absolutely no intentions of killing civilians.

Yes they did and thye said so - they said they went their with the
intention of killing all the men and all the women who got in their
way. Their *own* archives remember, this is not hostile testimony.

Sound van bogged down in a ditch. No warning given.

>By all rational standards, Dir Yassin was not a massacre. The killing
>was unintentional.

Yes it was and no it was not. It was a massacre - the murder of hundreds
of unarmed civilians who had no part in the fighting. The surviving men
were taken to the local quarry and shot in the back of the head. Not
intentional? Yeah right.

>The village housed Arab snipers and Arab troops.

No it did not - you have a source for this slander of course?

>attacked with intentions of killing any civilians.

The men involved said clearly that the intention was to kill all the
men. It was a premeditated mass murder nothing else.

>Holocaust is absurd.

On that we agree at least.

>The Irgun did not want to kill any civilians. The

Yes they did want to kill the inhabitants and many of them were killed.
This is of course simple to resolve, the Haganah sent a soldier to report
on the massacre. He brought a photographer with him. He sent in a report.
The Israeli government suppressed it. Now the government was a Labour
Government. Since then the Revisionists have gotten into power but for
some reason Likud didn't release the report and its pictures either.
Perhaps you might want to tell me why? If it happened as you claim then
there will be no pictures of men shot in the head with their hands tied
behind their backs, no women and children shot as they slept. Yet for
some reason they did not take the chance to clear their own name. You
have a reason for this don't you? I somehow doubt it. The facts are
exactly as the people responsible claim - a premeditated mass murder
nothing else. No Iraqi soldiers, no other fighting. Just ethnic cleansing
at work.

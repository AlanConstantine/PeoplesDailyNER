	A neutral organization would report on the situation in
Israel, where the elderly and children are the victims of stabbings by
Hamas "activists."  A neutral organization might also report that
Israeli arabs have full civil rights.

	Care to name names, or is this yet another unsubstantiated
slander?

	Terrorism, as you would know if you had a spine that allowed
you to stand up, is random attacks on civilians.  Terorism includes
such things as shooting a cripple and thowing him off the side of a
boat because he happens to be Jewish.  Not allowing people to go where
they are likely to be stabbed and killed, like a certain lawyer killed
last week, is not terorism.

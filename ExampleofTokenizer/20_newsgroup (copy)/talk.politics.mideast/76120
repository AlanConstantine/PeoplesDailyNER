	Finally you said what you dream about. Mediterranean???? That was new....
	The area will be "greater" after some years, like your "holocaust" numbers......




|>It has always been up to the Azeris to end their announced winning of Karabakh

		*****
	Is't July in USA now????? Here in Sweden it's April and still cold.
	Or have you changed your calendar???


|>Well, he was wrong! If Elchibey is going to shell the

	NOTHING OF THE MENTIONED IS TRUE, BUT LET SAY IT's TRUE.
	
	SHALL THE AZERI WOMEN AND CHILDREN GOING TO PAY THE PRICE WITH
						    **************
	BEING RAPED, KILLED AND TORTURED BY THE ARMENIANS??????????
	
	HAVE YOU HEARDED SOMETHING CALLED: "GENEVA CONVENTION"???????
	YOU FACIST!!!!!



	Ohhh i forgot, this is how Armenians fight, nobody has forgot
	you killings, rapings and torture against the Kurds and Turks once
	upon a time!
      
       

|>And anyway, this "60 
|>Kurd refugee" story, as have other stories, are simple fabrications sourced in

|>conversations as appeared in the New York Times supposedly translated by 
|>somebody unknown, from Armenian into Azeri Turkish, submitted by an unnamed 
|>"special correspondent" to the NY Times from Baku. Real accurate!

Ohhhh so swedish RedCross workers do lie they too? What ever you say
"regional killer", if you don't like the person then shoot him that's your policy.....l

        Turkey's government has announced that it's giving weapons  <-----------i
        to Azerbadjan since Armenia started to attack Azerbadjan		
        it self, not the Karabag province. So why search a plane for weapons	
        since it's content is announced to be weapons?   

	If there is one that's confused then that's you! We have the right (and we do)
	to give weapons to the Azeris, since Armenians started the fight in Azerbadjan!
 

|>You are correct, all Turkish planes should be simply shot down! Nice, slow
|>moving air transports!

	Shoot down with what? Armenian bread and butter? Or the arms and personel 
	of the Russian army?

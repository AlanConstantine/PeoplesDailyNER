It would be nice if, as you rightly point out the inherent value of
freedom of speech, discussion would also deal with the all-to-
frequent ritualized abuses and distortions of that freedom that do 
occur. There are situations where a few extremely vocal, and 
usually radical, people **do** drive people away, effectively stifle
all other ("opposing") views and generally "take over". *Clearly*,
the purpose behind such actions is *to deprive* others of *their*
freedom of speech through overt and covert coercion and domination of 
the "media form" in question. While "freedom" of speech is to be valued,  
this is not. How would you suggest that this sort of reoccuring problem be 
alleviated? More particularly, how can this be controlled within the 
structure of these newsgroups?

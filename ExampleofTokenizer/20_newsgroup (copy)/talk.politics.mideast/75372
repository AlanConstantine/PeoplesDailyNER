I have the sources for the information in the Chronology, including the
NY Daily News of March 5 that reports the arrest of Josie Hadas and a
copy of the foreign press reports of her release shortly afterwards.

What is the source for your alias story?

And pray tell me how can the FBI arrest and release an alias?

What has IQ to do with collecting information and putting it forward. Why
has the FBI refused comment on the Guardian reporter's question about
Hadas' link with Israeli Intelligence (the information did not mention
the Mossad explicitly).

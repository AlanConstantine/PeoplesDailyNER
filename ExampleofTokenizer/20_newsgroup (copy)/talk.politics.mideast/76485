            NEWS YOU MAY HAVE MISSED, APR 19, 1993
 
          Not because you were too busy but because
            Israelists in the US media spiked it.

                  THOSE INTREPID ISRAELI SOLDIERS
  
 
 Israeli soldiers have sexually taunted Arab women in the occupied Gaza Strip 
 during the three-week-long closure that has sealed Palestinians off from the 
 Jewish state, Palestinian sources said on Sunday.
 
 The incidents occurred in the town of Khan Younis and involved soldiers of
 the Golani Brigade who have been at the centre of house-to-house raids for
 Palestinian activists during the closure, which was imposed on the strip and
 occupied West Bank.
 
 Five days ago girls at the Al-Khansaa secondary said a group of naked
 soldiers taunted them, yelling: ``Come and kiss me.'' When the girls fled, 
 the soldiers threw empty bottles at them.
     
 On Saturday, a group of soldiers opened their shirts and pulled down their
 pants when they saw girls from Al-Khansaa walking home from school. Parents 
 are considering keeping their daughters home from the all-girls school.
     
 The same day, soldiers harassed two passing schoolgirls after a youth
 escaped from them at a boys' secondary school. Deputy Principal Srur 
 Abu-Jamea said they shouted abusive language at the girls, backed them 
 against a wall, and put their arms around them.
 
 When teacher Hamdan Abu-Hajras intervened the soldiers kicked him and beat
 him with the butts of their rifles.
 
 On Tuesday, troops stopped a car driven by Abdel Azzim Qdieh, a practising
 Moslem, and demanded he kiss his female passenger. Qdieh refused, the 
 soldiers hit him and the 18-year-old passenger kissed him to stop the 
 beating.
 
 On Friday, soldiers entered the home of Zamno Abu-Ealyan, 60, blindfolded
 him and his wife, put a music tape on a recorder and demanded they dance. As
 the elderly couple danced, the soldiers slipped away. The coupled continued
 dancing until their grandson came in and asked what was happening.
 
     The army said it was checking the reports.

      ISRAELI TROOPS BAR CHRISTIANS FROM JERUSALEM
 
 Israeli troops prevented Christian Arabs from entering Jerusalem on Thursday 
 to celebrate the traditional mass of the Last Supper.
     
 Two Arab priests from the Greek Orthodox church led some 30 worshippers in
 prayer at a checkpoint separating the occupied West Bank from Jerusalem after
 soldiers told them only people with army-issued permits could enter.
 
     ``Right now, our brothers are celebrating mass in the Church of the Holy
 Sepulchre and we were hoping to be able to join them in prayer,'' said Father
 George Makhlouf of the Ramallah Parish.
 
     Israel sealed off the occupied lands two weeks ago after a spate of
 Palestinian attacks against Jews. The closure cut off Arabs in the West Bank
 and Gaza Strip from Jerusalem, their economic, spiritual and cultural centre.
 
    Father Nicola Akel said Christians did not want to suffer the humiliation
 of requesting permits to reach holy sites.
 
     Makhlouf said the closure was discriminatory, allowing Jews free movement
 to take part in recent Passover celebrations while restricting Christian
 celebrations.
 
     ``Yesterday, we saw the Jews celebrate Passover without any interruption.
 But we cannot reach our holiest sites,'' he said.
 
     An Israeli officer interrupted Makhlouf's speech, demanding to see his
 identity card before ordering the crowd to leave.

 If you are as revolted at this as I am, drop Israel's best friend email and 
 let him know what you think.

 If you are tired of "learning" about American foreign policy from what is 
 effectively, Israeli controlled media, I highly recommend checking out the 
 Washington Report.  A free sample copy is available by calling the American

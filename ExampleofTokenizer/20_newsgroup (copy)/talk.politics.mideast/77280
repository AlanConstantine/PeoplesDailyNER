Infact on tuesday, the Bosnian foreign minister asked formally the UN to leave Bosnia,
just to show how much hypocracy is there in Europe. These so called UN is actually
helping Serbs carry out their etnic-clensing/murders/rapes. In Zepa the UN effectively
helped the Serbs carry out their heinous crimes by spreading conflicting reports that
nothing was going on there. The cowards, or so called UN peacemakers, only "attempted" to 
go out there for a fact finding mission -as if with all the ham-radio operators were lying
and all the US war planes out there have no means of flying over there. This is the biggest
farce in the history of the world and the same act has been repeated over and over again in
different beseiged Bosnian towns....

Yes! I heard today that the president of Bosnia- under pressure from the "civilized nations"
has appealed to the UN to stay there in Bosnia. He should know better..

These hypocrates (Sadly! it includes Clinton administration too) all came out and said
that the call for a referendum from bosnian serbian perliment (or a bunch of
rapists/criminals) is a farce and yet they have to wait for the result of this referendum
to act.... 

For those of you who are against US to commit ground troops, fine just lift the arms-embargo on BOTH
sides (since we know that serbs always got the heavy weapons form federal army). 

Wake up West!! and admit that you are the most uncivilized, the most hypocratic and the most violent
bunch on this earth...

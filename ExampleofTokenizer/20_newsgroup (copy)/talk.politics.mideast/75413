Both events took place, but not as you described them. It feels trivial to
nit-pick about details like this, and insulting to everyone involved.
But I feel that the truth is more damning than an exaggeration, and
much more likely to cause people to think when they read it.

In general, when I read an argument that uses inaccurate and inflamatory
statements (honest mistake or not), I tend to dismiss the entire argument
because of those errors.

The entire situation in the Middle East is too important to reduce to
back-and-forth propaganda -- it is precisely this reduction that further
polarizes the situation and makes peace, understanding, and reconcilliation
impossible.

Agreed. It would have been better if both situations could have been avoided.

[I accidently deleted the line about how it would be better if more of
 YOU PEOPLE would do something about disgust and closets]

What's this YOU PEOPLE stuff anyway? How does it contribute to a
rational discussion of the issues?

Frankly, I've received no mail on the subject, hateful or supportive.

   First this man promotes the dissolution of the Jews through an
intermarriage process, and then says that it will be just a bunch
of 'fundamentalist' Jews who will object.  This clown even called
for 'buying' the dissolution of the Jewish people.

   Does this idiot mean to suggest that any Jew who objects to an
imibicilic notion like this is fundamentalist?  Or does he simply
mean to insult the orthodox by using the word 'fundamentalist?'

   I am not orthodox.  I am not fundamentalist.  I would desire a
genuine peace in the region more than this pinhead  Davidsson can
ever understand.  But when he shows his willingness to dismiss an
entire culture, he proves that the only thing more brain-boggling
than his stupidity is his willingness to display his stupidity in 
this newsgroup.

  Please take your hatred for the essence of Judaism and shove it
up your ass.  Remember to pull your head out first.

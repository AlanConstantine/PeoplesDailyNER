Muslims already have, they accepted the Vance Owen plan that gives
50% of the population (Serbian statistics put it at 44%) only 25%
of the territory. They gave some totally Muslim villages and areas
to Croatia and Serbia, they in effect gave the Serbs the land they grabbed 
while slaughtering the Muslims anbd raping their women and expelling
the survivors.

Still the Serbs (NOT BOSNIAN SERBS because the real Bosnian Serbs are
fighting with Muslims to defend Bosnia from Serbs, those so called 
Bosnian Serbs refused to be part of Bosnia and wanted a greater Serbia),
still those Serbs refused, they have the necessary weapons to kill
more Muslims and grab more territory.

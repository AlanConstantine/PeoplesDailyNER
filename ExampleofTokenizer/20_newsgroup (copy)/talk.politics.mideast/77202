Well, -I've- been reading t.p.m. for a while and here is what I saw
YOU write:

In article <EGGERTJ.93May4220241@moses.ll.mit.edu> you wrote:

Your statment clearly tries to "balance" Arab atrocities by noting a
single incident by the Israelis in war-time at their most holy site.
You even characterize it as "an eye for an eye".  

You also wrote:

so now you have to find some source that notes that more than 1 mosque
was razed.  You then followed it with:

Really?  Do you still feel that Israelis are comparable in the running
amok with power with, say, the Iraqis?  Your "eye for an eye"
comparisons don't match the realities that most of us are familiar
with.

>Quoting from The West Bank Story, pages 35-36:

This happened to be during a war!  And a fierce and mighty war it was,
too.  Would you say that the Jordanians "indiscriminately shot up
ancient structures as is their custom" in describing bullet holes in
the walls of the city?  This was war!  It was certainly not any "eye
for an eye" characterstic.  Israelis do not harbor the same feelings
of revenge as the Arabs generally do.  This is one of the reasons that
the Peace Now movement exists in Israel and nowhere else in the M.E.

   I  must  finally  admit the total truth that is central to the
core of my being.

   I  am  a  homosexual.   Not  just  a  normal,  run-of-the-mill
homosexual,  but  a  rabid homosexual Zionist.  I hide behind the
facade  of  pro-Israel  rhetoric so as to deflect suspicion of my
true  motive:  the exchange of romantic dialogue with Nick Steel,
and  our  frequent  fudge-packing   adventures,  which   we  have
endeavored  to maintain at a discreet level.  Of course, the need
for discretion has been obviated by my own admission here.

   The  truth  is  that  I  could  no longer hold this saccharine
secret  any  longer.   I love  you,  Nick,  and  my  love for you
surpasses  that  which  I  hold  for Eretz Yisrael, may she stand
forever, as our love has, and as your erection insinuating itself
into my kosher rectum always will.

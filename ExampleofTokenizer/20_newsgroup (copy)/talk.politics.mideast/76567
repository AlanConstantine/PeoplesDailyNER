   Arab citizens have the all the same rights as Jews.  Arabs are
exempt from military service, but that is about it.  Arabs have a
full voice in Israeli politics, to the degree that they choose to
get involved.  They may vote.  There are Arabs in the Cabinet.  

   The claim that Israel is an apartheid state is a racist claim,
one which is based on a total disregard for the facts and a total
hatred for Israel.

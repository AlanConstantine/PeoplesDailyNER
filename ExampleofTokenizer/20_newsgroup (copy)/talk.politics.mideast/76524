Steve,

If the Israelis are stupid enough to "allow" a second "Palestinian"
state (the first one is Jordon), then you will probably get your
wish - and the Israelis would get what's coming to them.

However, if the "Palestinians" were to somehow demonstrate that 
they could govern themselves AND live in peace with their 
Jewish neighbors, then they would have to give up the idea of
Jerusalem as a part of their state - and you would be disappointed.

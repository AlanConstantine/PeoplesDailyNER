I don't, though when I was in Israel I did make a point of listening
to JTV news, as well as Monte Carlo Radio.  In the United States,
I generally read the NYT, and occasionally, a mainstream Israeli
newpaper.

What you may not be taking into account is that the JP is no longer
representative of the mainstream in Israel.  It was purchased a few
years ago and in the battle for control, most of the liberal and
left-wing reporters walked out.  The new owner stated in the past,
more than once, that the JP's task should be geared towards explaining
and promoting Israel's position, more than attacking the gov't (Likud
at the time).  The paper that I would recommend reading, being middle
stream and factual is "Ha-Aretz" - or at least this was the case two
years ago.

And what about the "Nat'l Enquirer"? 8^)
But seriously, if one were to read some of the leftist newspapers
one could arrive at other conclusions.  The information you received
was highly selective and extrapolating from it is a bad move.

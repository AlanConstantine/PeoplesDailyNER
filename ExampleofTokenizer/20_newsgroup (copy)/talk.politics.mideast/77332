Never mind the fact that these people were denied the right to a fair trial.  
And Israel was supposed to uphold "Western values", eh?

Check your facts before bashing Islam again. While there may be Muslim  
anti-semites, this is no way a tenet of the religion. Saying anti-semitism is  
"basic" to Islam is implicating the entire Muslim world, based on a selective  
sampling of a few people, and it flies in the face of what Islam teaches.

Peace.

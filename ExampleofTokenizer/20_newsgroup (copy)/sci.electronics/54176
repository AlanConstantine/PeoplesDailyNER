Can someone tell me where to find 120volt 3 watt 40 mA fans that
fit the standard computer mounting size )ie. 3 and 1/8 inch wide
and 4 inches diagonal from hole to hole (hole=where bolt or screw
goes through.  I have found higher (NOISY) fans that are 120 v
6 watt, but I need a quite fan.  I can use 12 volt as well, but
found just about all 12 volt fans to be noisy.  I also find that
the 120 v fans are not only quieter, but the blade shape has a lot
to do with it.  I have a dead fan that was quiet in it's day.  It
has long blades (like fan blades in a tturbo engine on a jet is
the only way I can describe it.  The dead fan is ETRI Model 126LH.
Actually it's not dead, it just makes a hideous rattle noise so
it's stealthy qualities are void.  Thanks.

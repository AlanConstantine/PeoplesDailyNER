While driving through the middle of nowhere, I picked up KNBR, AM 1070,
a clear-channel station based in Los Angeles. They had an ad 
claiming that they were able to get traffic flow information from 
all of the thousands of traffic sensors that CalTrans has placed
under the pavement. Does CalTrans sell this info? Does KNBR have
an exclusive? What's the deal?

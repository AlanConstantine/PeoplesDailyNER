Comments about "who needs backup copies"?  and "YOU do" deleted....

I'll toss in my 2 cents worth - I've begun to think that distribution
disks are made on some of the least reliable floppy disk stocks available.
We've been especially plagued by Borland's distribution disks.  I'm 
lucky if I can install from them as many as 3 times before they crap 
out on me.  So definitely, as a matter of course we ALWAYS make copies
to do our installations with.

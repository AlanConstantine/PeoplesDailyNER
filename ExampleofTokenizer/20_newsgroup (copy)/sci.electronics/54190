This definately gets the car going, but... WD-40 is highly flammable. Explosive
even in the right conditions, like a vapour sealed inside a distributor for
eg. And contact points tend to arc a tiny bit :)

I once saw the alternator/points cover blow completely off a motorcycle after
it had been restored to life with WD-40... fun to watch
(It was a Honda MR-50 minibike and the cover is only held on by large rubber 
grommet, so it wasn't really a big blast.)

PS As a more serious aside, it is apparently also conductive, so it is best 
to exercise caution with it around mains wiring.

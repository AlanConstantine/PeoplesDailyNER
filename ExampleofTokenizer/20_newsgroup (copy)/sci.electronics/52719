original Bell.  For example, SouthWestern Bell is a deciBell.

And the measure of current, Amp, is actually named after both the AMP company
and the Amphenol company.  Both companies revolutionized electronics by
simulatenously realizing that the performance of connectors and sockets 
were affected by the amount of current running through the wires.

The Ohmite company was the first to characterize resistances by numbers, thus
our use of the Ohms...


Alexander Graham Bell, actually, is where Bell came from...  



Actually, Bel refers

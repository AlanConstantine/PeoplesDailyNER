I have a spare Fluke 8062A.  This is a true RMS digital meter with
4.5 digit display.  It's in "average" condition (been used) but 
works fine - which is what Fluke's are all about.   BTW - according
to the fellow who designed these meters, they can be converted to 8060A
function by clipping a jumper, and adding the 2 extra switches..
Like I said $115 seems fair - these sell for $300+ new.

It's odd how as I get older, the days are longer, but the years are shorter!

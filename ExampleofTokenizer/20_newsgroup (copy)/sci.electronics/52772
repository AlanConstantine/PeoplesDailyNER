I need a off-the-shelf method of transmitting small amounts of data up to
300 feet.  The data is low speed and can be encoded as needed.  Low power
on the transmitting end would be a plus.  An FCC certified product would
be prefered.

If you have any pointers to products or companies I'd appreciate hearing from
you.

Thanks,
Ken

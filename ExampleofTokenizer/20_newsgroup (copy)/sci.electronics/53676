I have a Fujitsu M2322K which has been removed (I believe) from a digital
X-Ray machine (takes X-Ray pictures without film).  The Fujitsu part number
is B03B-4745-B002A.

I have obtained some data on the device, it is 8-inch winchester-type
of 168 megabyte capacity (though I was told it was over 800 megabytes).
However, there is very little information on the interface standard used.
It appears to use two balanced-line connections, but what each connection
corresponds to I know not. One connection is a 30-way IDC, the other a
60-way IDC.

If anyone has any information on this device, I would be most grateful
if you could provide it.

Thanks.


Chris Powell.

The HC711 is an EPROM version of the HC11. Raw HC11 parts have factory set
ROM images, and as such are useless to the hobbyist. HC811 parts have
EEPROM, allowing for electrical erasure and reprogramming.

Some Motorola parts (such as the HC705K1) have EPROM, making them user
programmable, but come with options of either windowed or sealed. The
more expensive windowed packages allow multiple use, the plastic dip
varieties are one-time programmable, since there is no way of exposing
the EPROM array to light.

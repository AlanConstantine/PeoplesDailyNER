Open up one of the airbag control boxes.  They have inexpensive piezoelectric
accelerometers in them.  I know that the GM cars use the Setra units.  The
cheapest way to get such an accelerometer is to cannibalize an existing
automotive unit.

Incidentally, these things aren't very linear, but for the application they
would do a fine job.

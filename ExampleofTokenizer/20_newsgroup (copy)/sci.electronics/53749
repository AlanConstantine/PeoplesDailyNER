Well, this is my second try at posting on this subject. Here goes...
	In Texas (Corpus Christi at least) if you pick up the phone and dial
	890 the phone company will read the number of the phone you are on 
	back to you. I believe the service department uses this to make
	certain they are repairing the correct lines when they open the BIG
	junction boxes. I don't know if it will work but you can give it a
	try. Good luck.

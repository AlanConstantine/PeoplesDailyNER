    Be careful.  The 41256 is organized as 4 64k sections and
    needs only 8 bits to refresh.  Whereas the 44256 has 4 256k
    (IE is a 1M dram) and requires 9 bits to refresh.

    How to you plan to use it?  Did Apple devlope a MMU system
    for the //e?  I know the Radio Shack Color Computer can work
    with 2megs (built in MMU with extras) now.

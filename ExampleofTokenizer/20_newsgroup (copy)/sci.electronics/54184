	Here is a list I get when I was combing through some microfilm one
day here at Drexel while completely board.  Most of these circuits are
pretty easy to constuct and can be done by a novice.
	This is basically some stuff that could prove useful to you without
having to sit down and either design or buy the stuff (not a good word, but I'm
tired right now).
	Hope you enjoy!

	If you have any additions send them to me and I'll add them to the list
.  They don't have to be from this particular magazine, they just have to be
interesting!

	or you can order the parts that you can't get through a normal store

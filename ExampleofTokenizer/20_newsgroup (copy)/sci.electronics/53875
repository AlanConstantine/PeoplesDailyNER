Try Cables and Chips ... let me dig out a reciept ...

Here we are...

Cables & Chips at 121 Fulton Street, that's near South Street Seaport and 
Wall Street.  Phone is 212-619-3132 and 800-843-4117.

However, when ordering there, be VERY exact or there's a good chance they'll 
screw up.  Otherwise, they're pretty good, and they deliver too.

Cheers,
Rob

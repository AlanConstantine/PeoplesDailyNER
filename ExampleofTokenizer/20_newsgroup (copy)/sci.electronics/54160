Does anyone know how the VGA video feature connector operates? I
would like to know which of the pins are inputs, which are outputs,
and which are bidirectional (if any - and how the direction is
selected).

I have found a pinout for the connector:

Video Feature Connector Pinouts.

Pin     Name   Function
1       PD0    Dac Pixel data bit 0
2       PD1                   bit 1
3       PD2                   bit 2
4       PD3                       3
5       PD4                       4
6       PD5                       5
7       PD6                       6
8       PD7                       7
9       -      Dac Clock
10      -      Dac Blanking
11      -      Horizontal Sync
12      -      Vertical Sync
13      -      Ground

14      -      Ground
15      -      Ground
16      -      Ground
17      -      Select Internal Video
18      -      Select Internal Sync
19      -      Select Internal Dot Clock
20      -      Not Used
21      -      Ground
22      -      Ground
23      -      Ground
24      -      Ground
25      -      Not Used
26      -      Not Used

And I assume that pins 1 - 12 are outputs, and 17 - 19
are inputs. Is this correct?

The reason is this - I have a Rombo Media Pro+ video
digitising card. It chroma keys its output into the vga
monitor signal. However, although it is supposed to work
with an ET-4000 with Hi-colour RAMDAC, the colours on screen
behave as if the top 2 bits of colour information are missing,
and red, green, blue signals are swapped around.
Rombo has suggested that this may be due to insufficient
buffering on the feature connector outputs, and is happy to
sell me a buffer device for 50 pounds.
I would rather save about 45 pounds, and build my own. I assume
it would require (for example) a 74F244 buffer IC (or two).

Can anyone help? Any information on the feature connector would
be highly appreciated!

Please could you reply by email :

because I am at home (easter holidays) and a 300 baud modem
is slow for reading news!

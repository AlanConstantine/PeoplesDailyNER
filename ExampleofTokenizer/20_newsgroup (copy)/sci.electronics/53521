I'm doing sound for a couple of bands around here and we need Direct
Input boxes for the keyboards.  These are the little boxes that take a
line level out of the keyboard and transform it into low-Z for the run
to the mixer.  Sadly they cost like $50 (or more) each and I'm going
to need like 5 or 10 of them!  I looked inside one (belonging to
another band) and it looks like just a transformer.  Does anyone have
any plans for building them?  Perhaps in Anderton's "Electronic
Projects for Musicians" book (which I am having a hell of a time
tracking down...)?

Thanks a lot!

I have written a program and I want to market it.  I would like certain degree
of protection, since my main custmers are individuals and not the 
cooperations.   I know laser hole burning method, and hardware key method,
however, my  software is going to cost only $15.00, so I can not afford that.
Also, at this low price I can not afford people make too many copy of my
software. Well, I guess say upto %20 illigal copying is ok by me.

However, I do not want someone to get a copy of PCTools and copy my software.  
Off course, I never meant to forbid the true hackers from copying, since they
can develope a better program anyway.

                      With highest regards,
                           Babak   Sehari.

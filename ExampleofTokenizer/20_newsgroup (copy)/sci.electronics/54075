Hi,
I am looking an integrated circuits for my Z80-based 
computer.
The circuit is called Z80-STI (Serial Timer Interrupt), 
MK3801, and
made by Mostek. Mostek is called SGS Thompson today.
 
I have been in contact with SGS Thompson, unfortunately 
they me told that Z80-STI is obsolete.
 
So, my question is if anyone know if I can get hold of that 
circuits. Are there any companies that specialize in selling 
circuits that are no longer in production? I have contacted 
several electronic brokers in
Sweden, but without any success. I would appreciate if you 
could give me hint where I should continue looking. Even 
companies in the United States would be fine, since this 
circuit is pretty crucial to me.
 
 
Thanks in advance.

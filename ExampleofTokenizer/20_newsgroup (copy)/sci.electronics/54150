I'm doing some work on the Mac IIsi and need some information on the CPU.
I have the Motorola MC68030UM/AD Rev. 1, but I fear it is out of date as it
does not have the characteristics for the CPU package type used in the IIsi.

What I need is the Theta (JC) Thermal Characteristic (the Junction to Case
thermal resistance) for the _PLASTIC_ FE style package.

If you have this info, I would appreciate your sending it by email as postings
suffer a few days delay here.

If you are keen on this stuff, I am also interested in a more accurate value
for the typical power dissipation. I'm assuming 2.25 Watts (using the 2.6 W
maximum at 0 C decreased the way the Pd drops in the 6801x as Ta increases).
If your manual has a chart of power dissipation, I'd like to know what it
reads at 25 C and 40 C.

Thanks for reading!

I have notice a lot of electronics questions by people who are obviously not 
"tuned-in" to electronics.  Many of them have rather simple answers, and 
many of them require a circuit diagram.

Rather than muck up the network, why don't you write to me, send a self-
addressed, stamped envelop, and I'll answer your questions, if I can.

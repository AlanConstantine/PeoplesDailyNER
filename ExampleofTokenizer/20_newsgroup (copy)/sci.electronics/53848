	Yes there is.  Not common for CB.  The pattern is different (sort of
	a cloverleaf, with four main lobes.

	Use of anything under 1/4 wave for transmitting is very uncommon.  (The
	usual "rubber duck" uses a coil to fool itself into looking like a
	quarter wave.
	I reccomend the ARRL Antenna Handbook, or a good basic book.

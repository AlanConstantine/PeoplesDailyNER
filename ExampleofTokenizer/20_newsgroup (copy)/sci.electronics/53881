Hey everyone, I'm new to this  newsgroup so please excuse me if this is a 
dumb question....I want to build a crossover for my stereo and I need
a coil with an inductance of 6.8mH (actually I need 4).  I was wondering
if anyone knew where I could buy these or how to make these.  I've called
many places and no one I can find sells them.  If you have the answers just
E - mail me....
Thanks in advance....
Chris

Some weeks ago, someone posted an article telling when and where
a hamfest and computerfest was going to be help in Dayton, OH.
Unfortunately, I lost the article and I was wondering if someone
could repost it.

I believe it was being held the 23,24,and 25 of this month at
the Dayton convention center but I'm not sure.

Any help and more details would be greatly appreciated.

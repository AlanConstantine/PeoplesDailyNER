	Check out a medical supply catalog, the thing you are looking for
is called a woods lamp (so you can check for woods sign, certain skin
conditions flourecse (sp) under UV light)  They come in disposable
penlight like types and larger ac powered types.  It is also used in eye
examinations, a flourescent dye is introduced to the surface of the eye,
then UV is shined on it, shows up scratches and abrasions very clearly
that would otherwise be very difficult to detect.  (for the completest the
dye is called flouescien, and in normal light appears orangish, and leaves
a mild burning sensation to the eye for 10-15 minutes, until the tears
flush it all out.  

Have fun.

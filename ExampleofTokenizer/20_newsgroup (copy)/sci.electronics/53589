Does anyone know what causes the ever-growing black border around the
edges of my computer screen?  The growth has been gradual so I don't
know how long it's taken to get this bad.  I have a 19" DEC (?)
color monitor, maybe five years old, and the black border is about 1.1
inches on the left and right sides, about 1.75 inches on the bottom and
negligible at the top of the screen.  The only controls are
brightness knob, contrast knob, deGauss switch, and power switch.

Is there anything to be done, or are the monitor's days numbered?

Just saw an article in New Scientist; AT&T videophones won't talk to (?)BTI 
videophones. The AT&T ones use a 19.2kb modem, BTI uses 14.4kb. AT&T models 
have to communicate using all AT&T exchanges, whereas the BTI can route 
via most current exchanges. Suggestions include building standards converters 
into telephone exchanges - the mind boggles :)= . The BTI design is a bit 
more conservative and is better able to cope with current data compression 
hardware on long-distance lines.

(not having the magazine to hand, I may have mis-remembered BTI. I think it
is a British one made by GEC-Marconi, and currently selling to other
countries). 

Yet Another Standards Screw-up.

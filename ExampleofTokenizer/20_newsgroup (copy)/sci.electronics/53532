Paul,

Unfortunately, there are not too many retail outlets that'll stock
just about every chip made.  The stuff they will stock are the ones
that'll sell, like standard DRAM's, 80386's, 68000's, etc,etc.
i.e.  I cna't think of any 'one-stop-shopping' store.

The closest you can get is to pick up a copy of Byte magazine or
the Circuit Cellar, Popular Electronics, and the like and flip
through them.

Distributors like Wyle Electronics, Hamilton Avnet, Pioneer Electronics,
etc, etc, don't normally deal with end-users like ourselves where
we only a couple of everything...they only deal with people who buy
by the hundreds or more.  Each distributor represents and sells a variety of
different non-competing manufacturers.  What do I mean by this?
Suppose ABC Electronics sells Intel 80386's.  It's a pretty good
bet that they won't be selling any of AMD's 386's, or vice-versa.
They also can obtain just about *any* chip you want from a manufacturer
they represent.

Who knows?  You might be lucky to be able to buy from one of them.
But I'd be suprised if you do.  ALso bear in mind that the 1 or 2
qty prices they will charge you will be *much* greater than what
a mail order outlet will charge.

My advice?  If you're gonna be designing anything, try to stick
with off-the-shelf stuff.  You're going to get stuck if you use
too many esoteric parts sooner or later.

good luck,

aaron

 So-Called Cool-Hot boxes have been advetised for several years.  I recall
Damark advertising them in a recent catalog.  Problem with the units is they do
a sh***y job of keeping food cold/warm.  The peliter devices used just don't
seem to have enough punch to keep up.  If you want something hot, you need to
heat it up before you put it in the box, and end up hours later with food thats
only moderately warm.  Same goes for cold items.

 You'de probably be better off getting a good Coleman(tm) cooler and stocking
up on "blue ice" blocks.

 Same as above.  Not enough "punch" in them to keep/get things cold/hot.

TriQuint (Beaverton, Oregon), has been selling an 8 bit, 1 GHz D to A
for several years.  I have used it and it works well, faster settling
time and smaller glitch area than any video d DACs I have seen.  Also,
they have been developing a more precise version that may be for sale
now - it's somewhere in the 10 to 12 bit area at 1 GHz.

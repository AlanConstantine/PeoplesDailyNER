       It's possible to make boards in other colors, and I have an ad
for laser light-show equipment which offers the circuit boards in your
choice of Day-Glo (tm) colors.

       The usual light green color is just the natural color of Fiberglas.
The dark green or blue is the solder mask layer, and I suspect that color
is a dye.

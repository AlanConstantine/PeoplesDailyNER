Once upon a time, long long ago in this news group, someone
posted a schematic for a 1-bit A/D converter.  Well I just found a use
for the little monster.  Anyone out there still got this text file?
It had a flip-flop, a resistor and a cap, and a comparator/op-amp I 
think.  I would be extremely thankful to anyone who could mail me the 
schematic or post it to the news-group.

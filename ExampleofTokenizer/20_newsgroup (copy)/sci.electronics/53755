Well, it's not an FTP site, but I got an 800 number for Signetics BBS.

The Signetics BBS contain some pretty good items for the 8051.  I am
currently using the following files which I downloaded from them:

    ml-asm51.zip      MetaLink's 8051 family macro assembler
    bootstrp.zip      Hex file Load-and-Go using 8051 uart
                      (allows you to download your program into a RAM
                       and then execute from RAM.  Works great.  Tell
                       me if you want more details).
    tutor51.zip       TSR for 8051 feature help screens
    
They have lots of coding examples, assemblers, and misc. tools.

Signetics BBS numbers are:    (800) 451-6644
                              (408) 991-2406

Have fun,

Anyone claiming that 1500 "real watts" isn't possible in a mobile should
dig through their back issues of 73 (and, I think, QST) for a description
of the mobile installation of that most revered of OMs, W6AM.  As I recall,
this included a Heath 1kW (DC in) amp (what was that model number...SB-
something....  my mind is turning to the usual Friday mush...) and was run 
full-out CW fairly regulary.  The car's electrical system had been modified, 
including a rather seriously-heavy-duty alternator, but such an installation 
HAS been done, and so IS possible.  This installation was the source of
the legendary story of W6AM sitting in the car, and paging his wife over the
department store PA systems!

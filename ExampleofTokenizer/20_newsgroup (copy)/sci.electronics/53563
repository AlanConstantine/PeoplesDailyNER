Wow, what a concept!  Does anybody want to speculate on how this
"non-connection" would fit into the theft of cable services laws?
It seems to me that unless this case is specifically written into
the legislation that the cable company would not have a leg to
stand upon in court.

Does anybody out there have any specific legal knowledge on this?

	Some TV's, including my RCA set at home, uses simple carriers
which I think run between 32 and 36 or 38 KHz.  There is no tone decoding
in it.  All one has to do to piss the thing off :-) is just hook an
IRLED up to a variable oscillator and tune through.  Wreaks all kinds
of havoc.  :-)

	Similarly, my VCR remote changes channels on my cable box.  Always
seems to change the cable box to channel 5 when you do the pause/play.

	SOOOO, some things do have some overlap to them.

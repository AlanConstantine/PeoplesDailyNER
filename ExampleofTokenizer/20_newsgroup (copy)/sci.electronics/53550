Anyone out there in netland have a spare data pod or two from an old 
1615A Hewlett Packard logic analyzer?  If you do, I'd like to buy it off
of you.  The pod's part number is 10248B.

As a side note, anyone know of any good surplus dealer or other organization
that would carry wayward logic analzer pods?

				Thanks a byte,

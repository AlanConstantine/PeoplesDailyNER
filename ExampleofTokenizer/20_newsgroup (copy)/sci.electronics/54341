>Rubbish. The reason for the colour of the boards depends on the solder

The May 1993 cover of QST has a picture of three different boards without
any solder mask (you can tell from the copper colored traces). The box
labeled 2304 transverter has the brown teflon/glass board, while the one
in the center has the grayish board exposed.  On the left is some 
fiberglass board that looks green to me.  I see no reason
for putting solder mask on circuit board used for box covers :-).

I wonder if any manufacturer actually puts a solder mask on their
low noise microwave preamps?  Often, microwave circuits have odd
bits of wire/foil/metal attached to wherever/whatever is necessary
to make the unit work properly (this is a commercial product?).  A
solder mask would certainly make doing this tougher, never mind 
the finding something that minimally degrades the circuits.  (Q dope
for coils *does* not improve the Q--it just holds things together with
minimal loss).

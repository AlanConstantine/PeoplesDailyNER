   This is message is only of interest to those going to 
International Symposium on Circuits and Systems that is being
held in Chicago this May.
   
   I checking to see if there is any people out there who would be
interested in getting together for a pickup game of soccer during 
the off hours of the conference. If so could you e-mail me at:

philc@macs.ee.mcgill.ca

I'll bring a ball. If you know someone who is going to the 
conference and you know that they are avid soccer players
please pass on this message to them. Also if someone in
Chicago is going to the conference please let me know if
there is any field near the hotel where we can play.

Thanks. Bye.

Philip Crawley

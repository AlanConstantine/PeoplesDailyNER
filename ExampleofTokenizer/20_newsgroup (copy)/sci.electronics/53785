Illegal to receive land-mobile telephone service?  Don't you have to have a
mobile reciever to even have land-mobile telephone service?  What about
ship-to-shore telephone service?

Isin't there some kind of rule (regulation, law, whatever) in some
juristictions that prohibit the use of *police band* recievers
in vehicles?  And that radar transmissions are included in the police band 
so they get covered by the same regulation?

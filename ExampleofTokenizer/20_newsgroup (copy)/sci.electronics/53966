Actually detecting a BREAK is done by watching for a "character" containing
all zero bits with the framing error resulting from its receipt.  This
means that the line stayed in the zero bit state even past the stop bit
time slot, which basically indicates a BREAK.  There is no special way to
detect BREAK that I have found other than this -- there's no magic signal
generated by UARTs, etc.

You can get a *little* UV by putting a heavy UV filter (deep purple) in
front of an ordinary flashlight bulb (the brightest you can get).
My father used a setup like this in law enforcement work circa 1964.

Good UV ("blacklight") bulbs work like fluorescent bulbs.  I'd proceed by
getting a cheap battery-powered _fluorescent_ light, then going to an
electrical supply house and finding a UV bulb that would fit it.

greetings..
I'm a novice in this area. I'm trying to gather info. on standard
phone line settings.
quick questions :
      > if I just want to send out a beep over the phone lines,
        can I do it with some function generator & tie it up to
        one of those phone wires ??
      > which one of those wires should I connect to my DTMF chip
        as AUDIO IN ??
 
any help would be much appreciated..
 
Thankx in advance - Handy Trisakti

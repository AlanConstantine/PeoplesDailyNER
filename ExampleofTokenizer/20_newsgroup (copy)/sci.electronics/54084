I just got caller-id (except Bell calls it "call display" and didn't know
what I was talking about when I asked for "caller-id").  I got the
cheapest display box I could find, and hope to convert it to serial out.

The chip used is an 18-pin DIP marked "CDT 14-285" and "1473 9220".
I presume the 9220 is the date.

I'm hoping somebody out there knows something about this chip, to save
me a very strange few hours hooked up to a scope, asking my friends to
call me again and again.

I'll post any interesting replies, and my experiences.

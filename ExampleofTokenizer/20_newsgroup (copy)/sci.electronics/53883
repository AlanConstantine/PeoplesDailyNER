Can I suggest the University of Western Australia in Perth.
The weathers great, the people are great and our Electronic Engineering department is great.
I am a first year student here ... so I don't know much about what projects but I do know they have a good reputation in the fields of dsp and communications.  Ever heard of QPSX?  The people who own are ex-UWA ... so that gives an indication of what the department is like.

For more information
email: yianni@swanee.ee.uwa.edu.au
with the above request and he should be able to tell some more info

or write

Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering
University of Western Australia
Stirling Highway
CRAWLEY 6009
Western Australia
Australia

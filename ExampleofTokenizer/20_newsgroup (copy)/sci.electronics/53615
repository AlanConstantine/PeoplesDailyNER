Hmm - I don't think you and I are thinking of the same thing. I was the
original poster, BTW. The accelerator that I'm talking about almost
certainly uses a 68HC000, according to the footnotes in the Supra ad. It
only costs $199 list, so I really doubt if it has a 28 MHz 68030 inside.

It's called the Supra 28, or Supra Turbo 28.
There's an external A500 model, and an internal A2000 model.

BTW, does anyone know if a 28Mhz 68HC010 exists?

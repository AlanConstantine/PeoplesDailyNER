1. Can low Voltage lights be controlled with an X10  module by putting it 
before the transformer? It seems to work, even the dimmer works. Not very 
reliable. Will it damage the module? Can it be done reliably?

2. I put a motion switch (Heath) to a low voltage light, it worked but now it is
broken, too much current? How can I get arround that? 
  
3. How can I increase the intensity of a light using the X10 PC computer
interface without having it go 100% on first and then down. I am doing
my own programing, not the X10 program.

Thanks   C. Montenegro

Funny . . . I and most of the detector-owning friends I have, are  
generally able to *REMEMBER* such things as nearby microwave towers and  
radar detectors going off in EXACTLY the same spon EVERY DAY . . ..

I know on I-64 at the Grayson, KY exit, there's a store just off the side  
of the road (think it's a Liquor store . . .) with what must be a security  
system that would make most federal prisons proud.  It's the only thing  
I've ever driven by (besides a cop) that puts my Whistler in "Oh my God  
he's Right Behind You!!!!" mode . . ..  I simply ignore the detector and  
use my eyes when I drive by that store . . . 40 seconds later, all's quiet  
on the front and no problem.

      Well, I've now been working on this DAMNED stepper controller board
 since 9pm.  It's now 6am... I'm pissed off.  Period.  Alright, I can
 drive the steppers through the 3479P's; no problem (that's with the
 6-wire steppers, 2 to +, and the other 4 are the phase lines).  Problem
 1:  I've got some 4 wire steppers.  I put the darkest line to + and the
 other 3 to the 3479P... worked, kinda.  Tried it with a printer stepper
 (moves the head back and forth, 4 wires), didn't work too well.  It 
would
 shift back and forth (use something like a 4017 instead?)  Also I've 
been
 trying to get a bunch of NPN's to work with it... NO LUCK... tried 
PNP's,
 still NO LUCK!!!  I don't know if I'm cursed on this or what, but I feel
 my brain slowly frying with the thought of STEPPER ... ARGGG!!!
         I don't know what's wrong with the transistor hook-up (to-220 
pkg
 type), also tryed the 2n2222-pkg type... no luck.

                         I'm going to try getting some z's, and I hope 
you
 can help me with this problem.
   If someone can please help me with this soon, it would be greatly
   appreciated...

                 Thanks.

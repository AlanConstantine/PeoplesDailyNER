: Look Guys, what's the problem here?  If you want a light that goes on when

: line, as I mentioned in my previous post.  If you want a light that goes on 
: when the 'phone is *on* hook, all you need is a voltage threshold detector.

If you're going to do the series Diode thing (which is the easiest), just
make sure that the LED can take the current (I can't recall it off-hand, but
it's something like 100mA or more?)

	Greetings. I've been seeing the word "storage" mentioned
	around oscilliscopes but I'm curious, what does it mean?

	If my life depended on it, I'd say that it's a scope that
	uses long-persistance phosphor to keep the successive
	taces on the screen for some unit of time - "store" them.
	Do I get to live?

	Also, I've been shopping for a decent, used, [old] scope
	since my Tek 514A (portable...NOT!) and my Heathkit O-1000
	are all single trace and I need more... like 2 or 3 and at
	least 50MHz (maybe 100...)

	During my shopping at hamfests etc. I've run into the 
	problem of "old scope" terminology. I can imagine what
	a "mainframe" and "plug-in" are but some things like
	the above "storage", "coax input" (Hey, where do I get a 
	probe that fits this? I had to fiddle with mine for a week 
	before I got anything resembling "a good trace" - they all
	come with BNC connectors!), "unblanking" (huh?), and, oh,
	just like my 514 manuals, MANY changes were made along the
	way to the schematic - scopes, even with IDENTICAL model 
	numbers, have different (better?) response/performance than
	others - how can I pick the better one? Does the rule of the
	higher SN the better apply?

	Take care.

Hi all,

I am looking for a new oscilloscope (BK 1541-B, it looks like, Goldstar OS904S
if I can find one cheap enough) and would like suggestions on a low-priced
source for them.

(Currently, BTW, Fry's electronics in Los Angeles has the 1541-B for $598,
 the best price I've seen overall for now - They carry the GS OS902S for 
 $490, but I need the 904S because of the 40 MHz B/W)

Thanks all.

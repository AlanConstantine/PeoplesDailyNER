I would appreciate some help in locating a telephone controlled power bar
for my PC. The unit would power up the PC when the telephone rings and
keep it up as long as the telephone connection is present.

I also need to be able to power up this same PC through the use of an external
timer. I can supply power or a contact closure to do this.

I will summarize and post the results of this query here.

Thank you.

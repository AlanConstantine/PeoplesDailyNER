If you use MEK for your sake wear safty glasses or better still
industrial goggles. The small est drop in the eye will casue
blindness by a catalysis reaction that is non cureavble once it starts.
The results are similar to mustard gas contamination. Note MEK peroxide
is a hardner form fibreglass resins.

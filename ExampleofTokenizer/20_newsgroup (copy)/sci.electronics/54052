The simplest and cheapest soft UV bulb is an AR-1 argon bulb (or other argon
bulb).  It works like a neon bulb except it glows purple.  It will cause
stuff to fluoresce.  It requires very little power, just a battery, an
oscillator, and a step-up transformer to about 100 volts.

Electronic Goldmine (602) 451-7454 has several UV lamps, both as pre-built
units and kits.  Ask for their catalog.

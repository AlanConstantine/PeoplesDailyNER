What a JOKE! You can't actually believe what you just said. Can you? We 
bombed and invaded these countries.

Notice the definition of war (from the American Heritage Dictionary):
	1) A state or period of armed conflict between nations or states.
This qualifies the invasions of Cambodia and Laos as wars.

Then let me explain this to you REALLY slowly. Why did he abuse the 
powers of his position? Could it have been to gain personal political 
power? Naw, that would be too obvious.

And anyone who can only call names because his position is defensless is
breathtakingly ignorant and desperate. I noticed that you edited out the
other points were I proved you and Phil to be completely wrong.

Really?  I thought that insurance companies hired all of
their actuarial staffs to determine the risks correlated
with all groups of people, and that gays are more likely
to have AIDS than are those of other sexual orientations.
If I am wrong about this correlation, please correct me.

My auto insurance company charges me up the wazoo because
I am a young male with a very high performance car.  I
always thought that this was based on NHTSA and other
statistical data, rather than bigotry and hatred for young
men with fast cars.  Of course, with the proper government
intervention, we could force the insurance companies to
pretend that young men with fast cars are just the same
as everyone else...

Yep -- and the child that "Tree Frog Johnson" adbucted for 6 months reportedly
"enjoyed" her experiences as well. They trained her using food. As an FBI
agent reported (on his disciplinary action for beating up "Tree Frog") "when
you see a 2&1/2 year old baby cheerfully tell you she wants a peanut butter
sandwich and she'll suck your pee-pee, you lose control".

You are quite sick.

There are actually people that STILL believe Love Canal was some kind of
environmental disaster. Weird, eh?

These opinions are MINE, and you can't have 'em! (But I'll rent 'em cheap ...)

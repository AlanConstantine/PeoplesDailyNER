And how did the "free love advocates of the 1960's" manage to perform
this demolition--forced breeding programs or something?

Now let me get this straight.  After a nice, long rant about how
people need to take personal responsibility for their economic and
social lives, all of a sudden 1960's radicals (such as me, I guess)
are responsible for poor people's lifestyles?  Tell me how that
works--or do you think that poor people are just too dumb to think
for themselves?

There are many reasons for the disintegration of the family and
support systems in general among this nation's poor.  Somehow I
don't think Murphy Brown--or Janis Joplin--is at the top of any 
sane person's list.

You want to go after my generation's vaunted cultural revolution for
a lasting change for the worse, try so-called "relevant" or "values"
education.  Hey, it seemed like a good idea at the time.  How were
we to know you needed a real education first--I mean, we took that
for granted.

	A few questions for Janet Reno:

	Why don't you think generals have any place in law enforcement?

	If the ATF/FBI had proof that Koresh was:

		A child molester
		A child abuser
		A wife abuser
		Bigamist
		Sexual Deviant (not a crime in all 50 states, yet)
	As well as
		Illegally modify weapons

	Why wasn't he simply arrested during one of his morning jogs?  Why did
the allegations of child/wife/sex crimes only come out after the Branch
Davidians repelled the initial assualt?

	Was it because it became necessary to demonize David Koresh?  Do you
feel responsible for the deaths of over 80 people?  How many would be alive to
day if Koresh had been arrested outside the compound?


	Inquiring minds want to know.

	[Although Janet was installed after the siege began, her purge of the
justice dept. leaves only her people in charge.]

   Rejoice! The Streets of Amerika are much safer now that the Branch
Davidians no longer have those nasty assault weapons. Your children will
no longer lie awake at night wondering when the next Brand Davidian will
attempt to shoot them from their rural compound. 

   Men, women, and children have been murdered by our great BATF, but the
greater good has been secured for all.

   Rejoice! `Criminals' who execise the second amendment will be killed.

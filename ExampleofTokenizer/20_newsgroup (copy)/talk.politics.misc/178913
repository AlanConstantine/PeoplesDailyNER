A very well put together post. I disagree with several key points, but the

Freedom of Association (FOA) involves the MUTUAL and VOLUNTARY agreement of
two or more people.

Right to Equal Opportunity (lets call it REO) involves coercion in all cases
(by definition).

Yes, there is much debate. But no, it can end, with once and for all
recognition of these rights. (Well, not totally 100% perfect end, but end
in the same way that there is no worldwide disagreement that say, murder, is
a crime).

Hmm, there is even MORE discusion about religion. Should  we take a 
"somewhere in between" approach towards the State & a State recognized
religion? The first amendment, is so, uh, so absolutist you know.

Why? Says who? Why can mon & pop have FOA, but IBM be forced, and force is
the correct word here, to have REO? As purchase of IBM is voluntary, then
there are very well defined procedures on how IBM chooses to do some things
and chooses to do other things. Why not let those same procedures work for
employment policies?

Why does this tenant have an "option" (I won't call it a right) to destroy
the FOA of the landlord? If the landlord and the tenant can't agree, then they
both can cease from using each other's property.

Suddenly, by arm waving, by magic, a landlord does not have FOA. And on what
basis does the FOA of the landlord "disappear"?

It seems that vague terms like "no contact with tenants" suffice.

Well, I think FOA is one our most important rightts (in the top 2-3), and by
golly, if the State is going to make it suffer, I sure would like to see the
heinous crime that justifies the removal of this right.

I don't think "no contact" with the tenats is even a crime, much less something
that should cause severe interference with important rights.

Rights are not defined by majority/mob choice. FOA is an absolute. REO
is a fancy name for thuggery, for racism, and coercion.

Of course it would be. You dimly see that the line must be artifiacial, because
FOA is the only right. Just like a State religion -- you can't jsutify that
either.

Why? I assume that when you say "publicly owned", you are talking about those
quasi-State companys that do NOT have shareholders.

The companies on the Fortune 500, for example, are all privately owned. They
can give you a list of all of their owners. They have no "anonymous",
unknown to them, owners.

FOA can be derived by any two rational people, on a basis that neither has
evil, malicious, or murderous intent towards the others.

In short, agreement is mutual, or not at all.

Your REO on the other hand, lives only by accepting coercion, the gun, into
the situation. And that is self-destructive of the whole argument, because it
is based only on might makes right. Sort of like saying, "nobody has a right
to live", whereupon I whip out a gun and shoot you dead -- end of argument.

There's a very good reason for it.  The insurance industry sets it's premiums
through a spread-the-cost-of-risk approach.  (Yes, even though 
non-smokers pay less, they still pay more than if there were no smokers 
at all.  And smokers pay for CEO quadruple bypass operations.  And it
just goes on and on.)  Insurance is capitalist-socialism at its very best.
And if you don't like it, you're only choice right now is not to 
participate at all, else start up your very own firm that ignores the 
risks you don't like.

In my lifetime, your philosophy -- socialism masquerading as a liberal

Absolutely.  So the response of socialists is take us even further
into socialism.

To the extent that people have been encouraged to NOT be responsible
for themselves, yes.

# # # # Come on.  You and I both know that the major problem of this society
# # # # today isn't a lack of employment, it's a lack of people willing to work.
# 
# # # Huh???  Tell that to the single mother I know who was laid off from

# # # Hey, she's too proud to go on public assistance, but the only jobs

Sonoma County.

# You live in a strange and wondrous place, sir.  Inexpensive housing,

Not exactly cheap, but not Los Angeles, either.

No, it's that areas with a lot of wealthy breed socialists -- all the
spoiled rich kids, feeling guilty about their wealth.  But not guilty
enough to give it away -- they just look for politicians to take MY
more limited wealth away.

# # # I see a lot of people willing--nay, eager--to work.  What I don't see

Yup.

# # # Mr. Cramer, I was there:  Hippiedom was a very low-budget operation.

#

# 
# Well, I doubt that much of this goes to drugs--there isn't much left after

I can tell you that relatives I have known, the drugs came first, the
food was secondary.

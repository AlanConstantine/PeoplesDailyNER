Pilgrim ... Founding forgot the taxonomy for a mo.

Jefferson etc were pretty hot on Religious freedom in part because they
were freemasons. At the time freemasonry was bing pushed as a sort of
alternative to christianity which was a little out of favour amongst
the intellectuals because of the propensity for religious wars. On the
continent the Masons were pretty much a way of denying the Pope's 
authority.

Latter on it science came up with an alternative explanation for why
the Universe existed and the intellectual necessity of creating a
creator lessened. If you don't have Darwin though Freemasonry is
probably the next best explanation as to the creation of the earth.

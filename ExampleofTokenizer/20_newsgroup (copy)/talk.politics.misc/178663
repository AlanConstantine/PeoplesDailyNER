I agree with the body of your post, but please reconsider your phrasing
here.  I think these ideas are selfish AND rational, which
is commendable.

Don't give selfishness a bad rap.  If we were all selfless there would

in mindlessly serving your fellow man with no thought to the importance
of the self.

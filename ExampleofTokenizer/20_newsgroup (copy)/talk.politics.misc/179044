         The BATF warrant was unsealed yesterday.

         The entire operation was illegal from day ONE.


       No authority for a "no-knock" raid.
       No authority to use the Texas helicopters.
       No authority to search for a "drug lab".  More ATF lies.


       Clinton and Reno are lying fucks.

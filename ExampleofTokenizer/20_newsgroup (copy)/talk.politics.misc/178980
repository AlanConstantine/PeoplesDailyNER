I bought mine at the MOW storefront.
Its not plastic, its woven material.

but I think you miss the point.
its not about the five bucks in your pocket, its about supporting the
march and helping to pay for all the printed materail and scehdulkes and
organisation and...

all leading up to the literal *birth* of Queer visibility in this country.

up to this point all our news coverage has been driven by events thatb
happen to us. 
this event is happening by our direct action.
of course the last MOW was the same thing but they ignored us.
I guess that was just labor pains.
perhaps they will ignore us again, in which case we will come in
even largeer numbers next time.

Lst night in DC there were so many queers out and about you could hardly get
in any place.
I suspect thatb over the next two days that will become exponentially
larger.

To my mind this is a physical bsuting down of the collective closet of
queer invisibility.

the five bucks is insignificant.

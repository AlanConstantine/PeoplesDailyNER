# Recent studies have shown that the number of men who have

# So, what can we deduce from these figures?  Are there a lot

# (perhaps women too) not as honest as they used to be about

You mean, in the 1940s, men and women were much more open about
their homosexuality than today?  Want to try that one again?

# this survey were assured of their anonymnity so they should

# 
# Perhaps if Americans were more open about there sexuality---I think
# most Americans aren't---then we might discover that there are really
# quite a few more people out there who are orientated toward the same
# sex---men and women included.  I'd venture a guess that there is a

# didn't take their longings seriously, but this doesn't make these
# longings any less valid.  Therefore, if Americans weren't so
# repressed about their sexuality in general---as I believe they may be
# ---then we'd see a lot more people "coming out of the closet".

You mean, ignore study after study, so that we can continue to 
accept a study (Kinsey's) that is obviously wrong?  

# As for myself, I'm a heterosexual and I've never considered having
# sex with another man.  That's just the way I am...I could have just
# as easily of been gay I suppose.  One of the big debates about
# homosexuality is whether or not it's a type of behavior that is
# learned or if one is just born that way.  IMHO, the more likely
# explanation is that it's some combination of the two.

Based on what, besides your own warm fuzzy feelings?

# Here's something to ponder upon:  have any of you gay-bashers out
# there ever considered that homosexuals probably deem their sexual
# orientation as being a state of affairs that is just as much an
# intrinsic and "natural" part of their life as heterosexuals do
# about their own sexuality?  In other words, someone who is *truly*

Alcoholics share that feeling, until they hit bottom.

# gay may not be able to live any other way.  Even if they date someone
# of the opposite sex or get married, in their *heart* they are still a
# homosexual.  Likewise, if someone who is *truly* heterosexual forms
# a relationship with someone of the same sex, then they are *still*
# a heterosexual even though outward appearances may suggest otherwise.

Unless, of course, the problem is that homosexuality is a form
of mental disorder, caused by childhood sexual abuse, as a number of
recent works suggest.

If homosexuals would stop using the government to impose their
morality on others (antidiscrimination laws) and leave our children
alone, I wouldn't care in the least what they did in private.  But
until they get over the liberal notion that the proper role of 
government is to tell peaceful people how to live, I have no choice
but to continue to point out that homosexuality is not an "alternative
lifestyle," but a sickness.

	The search was a "no-knock" warrent.  Meaning that what
those on the scene see is a bunch of men with guns storming 
their compound and lobbing grenades at them.  The terms of the
search warrent are secret and the BATF has yet to even reveal
what they were.

	They did not serve a warrent, they basically attacked the
compound and expected a surrender.  They had semiautomatics and
concussion grenades that we KNOW about.  

	Look at the death and injury toll inflicted on both sides in the first
battle and its difficult to believe that either side had any
superiority in weapons.

How wrong you will be.  I participated in the last National March on  
Washington (MOW) for LesGayBi rights (Oct 11, 1987) - with a turnout of  
about 750,000 people - and we didn't have alot pissing us off at the time.   
The big issue was the AIDS crisis, but we weren't being slapped around  
quite as bad as we are now.  This time its AIDS, and Equal Rights,  and  
the Military Squabble.  And this MOW has been in the planning for YEARS  
whereas the last one was pulled together in a relatively short time.  The  
last MOW was the largest ever on D.C. and you can bet we are going to  
exceed that by a long shot.  I truly believe we will exceed the 1.0  
million goal the MOW committee has always had set for this event.

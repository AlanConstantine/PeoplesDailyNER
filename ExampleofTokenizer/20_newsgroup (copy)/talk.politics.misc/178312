Cal State University system offers bachlors and masters degrees.  The
Ph.D. is not offered, because of opposition from UC.

Nearly all the professors have PhDs.  I haven't had a professor who didn't,
though my wife has had a couple of professors with just an M.A.  A friend
had an instructor who didn't have a degree at all, but because he had
been Minister of Culture for the Black Panthers, he was teaching anyway.
He had a bad habit of usually not showing up to teach the class, and
finally quit in disgust at the racism of a university that expected him
to show up to teach.

At Sonoma State University, typical class size is 20 to 30 per class.
Teaching is definitely more the goal, and sometimes, it actually happens.
The best professors at Sonoma State U. are equivalent to the best 
professors I had at UCLA and USC.

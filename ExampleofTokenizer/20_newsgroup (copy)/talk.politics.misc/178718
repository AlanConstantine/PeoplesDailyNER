But you stated that this study was presented in a very accurate and
dependable way.  This is confusing to the issue.

And if you read this title it implies that; gay sex (homosexual sex)
activities are low compared to the general population that they surveyed.

Well let us quibble- look at the above statement that you posted, I have marked
it with '^^^^^^', IT STATES THAT 1% ARE EXCLUSIVELY HOMOSEXUAL- IT STATES 2% ARE
OR HAVE ENGAGED IN HOMOSEXUAL SEX.

And please not the use of adjective here "HOMOSEXUAL SEX".

Now I stated that if we take 1% as homosexal this is a valid viewpoint.

I believe that you are either 1) you are not writing what you think you are
writing, 2) you can't read or remember what you wrote.

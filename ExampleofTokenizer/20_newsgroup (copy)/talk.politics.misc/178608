Good grief!  I do believe that for once you may have an argument which may
be discussed intelligently!

I guess that you are a person who dislikes contact with people of ethnic
minority.  However, your argument again falls flat on its face.  You state
that you, under an anti-discrimination bill, would be forced to associate
with others [homosexuals, I assume] against your will.  How do you know that
you do not associate with them now, except they may be closeted?   Would you
like to change your argument to read "forced to associate with truthfully
homosexual people against my will"?  You have no proof that anyone you
now know may not be homosexual and this punches a large hole in your
argument.  Is it your belief that a homosexual comes in only one flavour (sic)
and that is the camp mincing type?  Prove it.  You cannot.

I must admit though, that it looks as if you actually thought about your response
this time instead of just raving.

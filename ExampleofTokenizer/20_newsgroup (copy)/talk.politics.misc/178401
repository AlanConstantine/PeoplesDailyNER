***Sure!!! And what's .3 of a woman??? Any hypothesis??

   How can you trust a report from people that have *no idea*
   of what a MEDIAN is?

   The same bullshit article reported that 22,5% of all the men have
   sex 10 times or more a week (Elf, how many times did you fill
   one of those questionnaires?) and had other statistics that took
   in no consideration different class backgrounds, marital status
   etc.  No information on sampling were given.

different (and discutible) surveys???

>straight men vs. gay/bi men -- that would show even more dramatically
>how much more promiscuous gay/bi men are.

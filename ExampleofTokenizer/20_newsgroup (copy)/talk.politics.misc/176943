Since we are talking in theory and opinion, then I'll put in my $.02.
	First, a rebuttle. Personally, I love under-dogs. Unlike 
bandwagon jumpers, I abandon teams when they start winning. People that
cheer for winners just because they are winners are insecure people who are
afraid to be associated with something negative.

On this one point, I agree. The reason that people bash WASP's is 
because they have been on top for a long time. Whoever is on top is
going to oppress whoever is below them so that they can stay on top.
If Hannibal had pushed on to Rome after his victory at Cannae we might
all be bashing the blacks for oppressing us peacefull white people 
for all these centuries. I seriously doubt that if the blacks had 
conquered the world that they would have treated their colonies any
better/worse than the whites did.
	The white race did some unspeakable things to the other races of
the world. But they only did what any other conquering race would have done
(ie. Khan). The real question is, should we carry over that blame to the
present generation who didn't participate in the crimes? Would it do 
any good? Has it done Bosnia any good? They are fighting wars that stopped
hundreds, even thousands, of years ago. 
	My opinion is, if there are inequities now, then let's change
them. But don't blame me for what my ancestors did. It wouldn't settle
anything anyway.

That's where you are dead wrong. You don't join up on a side just because
they are winning. That makes you spineless. Winning, in high school and
after high school, is still the best way to be popular, but it doesn't make
you right. All the best causes in history were loosing causes (with only
a couple exceptions). Winning only makes a difference to other people, not
to yourself. And what good is the opinions of other people if they only care
how you appear (ie. a Winner).

	If you can't beat them, fight them every inch of the way.

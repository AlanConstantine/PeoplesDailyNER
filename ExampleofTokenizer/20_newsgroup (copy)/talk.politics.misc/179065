	_However_, a sizable fraction of _these_ are willing to get
abortions. One study found that at some places at least, 1/6 of the
women professed to be "Born Again". Furthermore, a large fraction of
Catholics use "artificial" birth control methods frowned on by the
Church. So this abortion-rejecting health-care market might be much
smaller than one would think.

	But never underestimate the willingness of some professed
opponents of abortion to get them.

	"If you are against abortion, DON'T HAVE ONE!"

	goes one pro-choice slogan I once saw on someone's car (or was
it a pickup truck?). I had been following an old railroad line that is
to be used for a BART extension in South San Francisco, and I saw this
car with this bumper sticker along the way.

	Operation Rescue? Dennis Kriz, be aware of some of the company
you keep. I'm talking about seriously militaristic right-wingers who
would _love_ to execute those who provide and get abortions. Although there has
been only one such assassination so far, I wonder how many other
opponents of abortion would be willing to perform such assassinations
if they could get away with it.

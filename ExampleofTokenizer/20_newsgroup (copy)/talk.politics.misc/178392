     I'm curious why you took a beign statement and cross-posted it to several
different news groups, including something along the lines of alt.discrimination  Look Rodney King is black and large.  I have several large black male friends,and they are referred to as being large black men ( to their faces, and by
themselves ).  You know, Ted, I have a large number of adjectives for you,
but I will spare you most of them because I try not to get into personal
flame wars.  Let me just say that I think your action of cross posting this
was total BS, and you're trying to start some crap.  Hopefully, others will
see through your trite little game and not play along.

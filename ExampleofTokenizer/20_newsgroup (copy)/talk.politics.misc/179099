    This is the first I hear that Koresh refused to release
    someone.  In fact, a lot of people, including children, came out
    during the stand-off.

    How do you know Koresh killed his followers?  The FBI said
    he had had no such plans (and they had the place bugged), Koresh's 
    attorney said the same thing, and the survivors claimed that the 
    fire was started by goverment agents.

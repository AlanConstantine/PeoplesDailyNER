TB>>SU>you would also outlaw abortions in rape cases?

TB>>Kill the baby for the crimes of the father? If that where adopted a lot
TB>>of people would die.

TB>There appears to be a single part of the three necessary elements for a
TB>pregnancy omitted from the above expression of your concern.  The Mother.

TB>rape and could very well lose it in the kitchen trying to give birth?
TB>That's too bad.  We *must* force her to put off her personal struggle to
TB>survive for nine months!  Why murder the innocent Baby?"  Sometimes,
TB>it's not murder...it's mercy.

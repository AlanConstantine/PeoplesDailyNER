	Without having a complete answer to this question,  I should think
it obvious that the first step should be to convince people this would be
a desirable result.  There are still quite a lot of people who feel that
the command economies of eastern Europe failed due to corruption rather than
essential weaknesses of caommand economies,  and you still have a majority
in this nation that favors keeping unenforced and unenforcible laws on
the books in order to "send a signal".

I fail to see why you should feel this way in the first place.  Constant
combat isn't particularly conducive to intellectual theorizing.  Also,
they tend to get invaded before they can come to anything like a stable
society anyway.

Umm, is there any distinction between "vague" and "elastic" in this
context aside from one having a more positive connotation than the other?

At any rate,  we've been through all this before.

Incidentally,  this is a libertarian newsgroup,  you can get away with
saying,  "bullshit" here.   You're welcome,

   I am glad that you recognize that people should not engage in denial
and repression, and should acknowledge such. The United States, with
its people, have recognized that repression has taken place, with the
loss and outright abrogation of civil liberties and constitutional
protections of citizens. This recognition has taken the form of the
civil rights law (let's just discuss the federal level for now), such
as 18 USC 241 et. seq., 42 USC 1981 et. seq, et. al.
   With this recognition of repression, at times manifested in the
form of collective guilt, I want people to recognize denial. 
Though it can be said that white people numerically commit more
crimes in the United States, because white people are a majority,
it can also be said that black people commit a disproportionate
amount of crime in the United States, in their relation to their
numbers in population.
   My views are out of experiences when I was a police officer
in a large metropolitan area, and of a citizen. Unless people
account for their behavior, and for the behavior of their immediate
community, nothing will improve.

Regards, 

Neal

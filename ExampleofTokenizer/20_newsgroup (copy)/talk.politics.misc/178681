     Bzzzzt.  THANK you for playing, but obviously you are not reading the 
  material as it is presented.  According to the report I've got in my 
  hands, the Newsweek article (which reported that "2 to 3 percent" of the 
  population is gay) used the criteria of "No heterosexual contact in the 
  past year."  But at the same time, the University of Denver study points 
  out, quite dramatically, that 60% of all self-identifying gay men have 
> had some form of heterosexual contact in the past year. 

I think the big mistake in that study must be that if one had had no sexual 
contact of any kind in the previous year, they are counted as heterosexual.
Even if they didn't intend it that way, that's how the figures are being used.

I'd like to conduct a small survey relating to Americans' views on economics and on Japan.
The survey consists of just two questions.  I ask that only Americans respond; I've posted
it worldwide, however, because I think others will be interested in the results.  I'll
tabulate the results and post them with some commentary.  Please respond by email to
"borden@m5.harvard.edu".  Here are the questions:

1) As an American, would you prefer that in a given year, a) our economy grows by one
   percent, and Japan's economy also grows by one percent, or b) our economy grows by
   two percent while Japan's economy grows by three percent?

2) On what newsgroup did you read this survey?

Thank you for your participation.

Barfling brings us some curious stories that haven't been reported
outside of fertile imaginations.  This fits in well with a report in
the New York Times from April 18, 1993:

Scores of Girls in Egypt Faint in Classrooms
By Chris Hedges
Cairo, April 17

The khamseen, the blustery sandstorms that arrive every spring, have
brought with them not only the usual clouds of grit and dust but also
what the authorities describe as collective hysteria.

Hundreds of teen-age girls have been fainting en masse in classrooms,
breaking out in sobs and complaining of unpleasant smells and nausea.

[...]

"There is no clinical reason for it," said Dr. Ahmed Rashed at Agouza
Hospital, where dozens of girls have been tested.  "It's just
hysteria.  We have carried out blood tests, urine tests, every kind of
test we can think of and nothing has shown up."

More than a thosand young girls between 12 and 18 have suffered
attacks in some 40 schools across the country since the first cases
were reported over two weeks ago.

[...]

Lawmakers and commentators have attributed the fainting to everything
from food posoning to a plot by unamed enemy agents to make Egyptian
women infertile. 

Similar attacks have been reported from time to time through Europe.
One was reported about a decade ago in the Israeli-Occupied Gaza
Strip. 

Islamic fundamentalist leaders have blamed the Israeli secret service
for the spells.  "This is all the work of the Mossad," said a militant
cleric in Imbaba, a Cairo slum.  "They are seeding capsules around the
country that release something into the air that can't be detected.
It has a special effect on the hormones of young girls.  It is part of
a plot to destroy Egypt."

  [Where have seen this argument before?  Because there is no
  evidence for the conspiracy, therefore it must be true...]

[...]

Health Minister Ragheb Dewidar said that neither medical or
environmental tests had found any contaminant and that the cause was
psychological.  "If one girl who is popular or a leader feels faint
for some reason," he said, "the others start believing that they are
suffering from the sypmtoms."

But no one is taking the matter lightly.  Prime Minister Atef Sedki
has held regular mettings with Mr. Dewidar to discuss the attacks.
Government officials say they are determined to bring the phenomenon
to an end.

"Parents and teachers should fight against these rumors and accept the
results of our scientific analysis," Education Minister Hussein Kamal
Bahadeen said.

Of course they did, otherwise they wouldn't have staged the
raid in the first place.

Napalming seems a bit redundant.

The Stupidity was in the BATF mindset 'We're from Washington
We Know Better"  Execute Plan A: Storm the compound in a No-Knock
- the locals are gullible rubes, who cares that they served
warrents by knocking on the door.  Such an old fashioned, out dated
method of Law Enforcement anyway.  Gotta have the latest Armament
Technology, doncha know?

Sweet baby buddah - didn't these clown ever read "Dealing
with Paranoids"?

Go for it.  I have yet to see anybody justify the
prohibition on drugs and the ensuing War On Drugs.  In the world of
*.politics here on Usenet, it is YOU that is crazy.  ANYBODY--who gives
the matter any thought beyond reading headlines---cannot justify this
atrocity, this all out war on individual rights.

Just _TRY_ to justify the War On Drugs, I _DARE_ you!

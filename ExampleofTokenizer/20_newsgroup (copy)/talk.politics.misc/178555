I totally agree.  Really, the only people this is going to benefit, are
those who live in the cities where the train stops.  Who wants to drive
to the train station from X (Lubbock for example)?  It's probably farther
to drive to the train station than it is to the nearest national airport.

I really can't see spending 5.7 billion on a system that only three cities
will benefit from.

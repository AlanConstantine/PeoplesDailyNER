This was in Wed. WSJ.

[start]
The white house, seeking to mount public pressure on GOP senators, bombarded
news outlets in some senator's home states with news releases warning that
certain projects may not be funded if the $16billion stimulus bill isn't
passed.

None of the projects mentioned are actually in the bill, rather they are
part of a wish list that may be funded from the $2.56 billion in
Community Development Block Grants.

...

[end]

I could have sworn I heard a bunch of Clintonites going on and on, raving
about how dishonest it was that the Rebublicans were taking items from this
wish list in order to ridicule this bill. Now that Clinton is using that
same list in order to garner support for the bill, are you guys going to
do the honarable thing and say that Clinton is being dishonest.

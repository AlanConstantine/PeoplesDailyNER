This statement is just so blatantly disgusting and free of any implicit
neural activity that I will almost completely ignore it.

Sigh.  It's so amusing to watch bigots point fingers at what they imagine to
be other bigots.  I do believe this person meant "bean *counting*".  And are
you trying to suggest that only Hispanics eat beans?  Or that they even have
a monopoly on eating beans?  Or that this person is seriously promoting what
is obviously a tongue-in-cheek .sig?

You must have a brain somewhere, if you can cause your fingers to type.  Use
it.

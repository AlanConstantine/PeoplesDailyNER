Although I can understand why you think the comparison might be valid,
I would have to disagree. The Jews who found themselves alone against
Rome on Masada faced a future which was infinitely bleaker than the one
faced by the Branch Davidians. The latter, in reality, would likely
have been charged with weapons violations and other sorts of crimes.
Most of them would have likely gotten off entirely. It is highly
unlikely that anyone other than Vernon Howell would have been been
imprisoned for very long. But regardless, most of the people, and
certainly all of the children, would have been allowed to leave, and if
they so chose, join another cult.

The Jews on Masada well understood their likely fate from what had
already happened. Had they surrendered, the men of fighting age would
probably have been put to death, perhaps crucified.  The women and
children would have been enslaved. None of them would have been likely
to practice their religion again.

I understand that Howell/Koresh and perhaps others will argue that the
fate of the Branch Davidians was "equally" onerous and that they were
fighting for religious freedom. I guest that's a judgement call...

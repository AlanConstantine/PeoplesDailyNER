The fact that she was wearing a miniskirt with no underwear was
presented as evidence that she was a prostitute, and the court
apparently found this compelling.

Clayton does indeed know the difference.  Greg apparently doesn't.

Because the judge found that there was some credible evidence that the
Marines were engaged in self-defense.  Got it, knucklehead?

Because, in part [REPEAT AFTER ME], "the judge found that there was
some credible evidence that the Marines were engaged in self-defense".
Hopefully, one of these days you will understand.

With respect to credibility, I would rate Clayton Cramer an order of
magnitude higher than a) the news media, and b) homosexuals.

Clayton is indeed consistent.  And so are you.

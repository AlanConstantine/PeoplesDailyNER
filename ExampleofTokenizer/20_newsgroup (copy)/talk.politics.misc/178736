I haven't recognized any names from previous discussions, but I do
notice that there are a few who blame Clinton for the actions of the
BATF in Waco.  Unless you felt the same way about what we did under
Bush's *direct* command in Panama, it's just partisan whining.  Which is
what I expect most of it to be.  I can see no way to condemn one and not
the other.  

But I'm sure some Limbot will tell me how killing thousands of
Panamanian civilians to serve an arrest warrant is much better than
allowing 80 religious fanatics to commit suicide following a botched
attempt by the BATF to serve a search warrant.

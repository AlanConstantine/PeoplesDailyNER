       Well, there does have to be a line.  And to be honest, extending
voter registration to DMVs is hardly analogous to having only one
place for registration in Alaska and opening a new one in Atlanta.  More is 
not always better once you've passed a certain point.

       I thought the Motor Voter bill passed.

       In any case, my experiance with Tennessee's voter registration
system (which you can register with by mail, by the way) is that nobody
who is interested in voting is being denied access to registration.
All it requires is just the tiniest bit of interest on the registrant's
part and thinking about the election once in the eleven months prior to
it.  (Once you register it's good unless you miss for years worth of
elections of move.)

       It's easy to register now.  I simply don't see the value in going
out and trying to get people registered who don't have enough gumption to
even write and have the proper forms sent to them.   How can we expect
responsible decisions out of these people?

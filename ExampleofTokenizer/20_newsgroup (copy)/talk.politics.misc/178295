The most recent reason given by the Clinton Administration for
calling for federally funded abortions is that many private
health insurance programs offer coverage for abortion.

The following are two form letters regarding this.  Please send
them around to friends as well as other BBSs

RE: Abortion and my health insurance coverage


TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

I recently have become aware that my health insurance includes
coverage for abortion.  I strongly oppose abortion for reasons of
conscience.  It disturbs me deeply to know that my premiums may
be being used to pay for that which I sincerely believe is
murder.  I would like to request that I be exempted from abortion
coverage with my health premiums reduced accordingly.

                              Sincerely,



My policy number is:

To your state and national representatives:





RE: Abortion and health coverage

Dear 


It has recently come to my attention as a result of the current
abortion debate that my health insurance coverage provided by my
employer may include coverage paying for abortions.  

I strongly oppose abortion for reasons of conscience and am
disturbed greatly that my coverage may be being used in this
manner.  However, I depend on my employers' provided health
coverage, and fear that if I speak up about it, that I may lose
not only my coverage but even my job.

I would like to ask you to put into law the provision that health
insurance providers make abortion coverage non-compulsory in
their health insurance program, so that it can be declined, with
an appropriate reduction in premium.

In order that there be no difference in the dollar ammount in the
health benefit packages between those who would choose to have
abortion coverage and those who would not, I further ask that you
include a provision in which the reduction in premium resulting
from the declining of "abortion coverage" be paid-out to the
employee, rather than pocketed by the employer.  

This second provision should serve to dissuade employers from
pressuring employees into taking one or the other stand with
regard to abortion services.  Thank you very much.  Your fellow
citizen.

                                   Sincerely,



----------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. I've been reading ca.politics for a while now, and I don't recall

You don't read *my* postings very carefully; I'm not surprised.  It
was pretty shocking, and is part of why my sympathy (though not
agreement) with the pro-lifers is increasing.

When did I say that it was?

When they hold high public office, you should worry.

# By the way, when you cite experts, remember that Carl Sagan and Paul

You mean, I don't come to the conclusions that your emotional
state requires.

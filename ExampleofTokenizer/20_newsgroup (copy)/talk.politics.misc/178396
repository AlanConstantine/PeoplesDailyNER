Probably because more people have access to alchohol.  It IS LEGAL you know.

Of course, this kid would be much better off selling crack to his neighborhood 
and helping in its demise.

And if those drugs were legal, the neighborhood could legally go to hell.

And if we made murder legal, we would put an end to murder as a crime.

So you are saying crack babies who are that way legally are okay?

You can't even walk down the street at night alone in America because of drugs.
Freedom my ass.

Aviation Week March 15 1993 p.48

"the CBO estimates that matching the capability of 100 C-17s would
require 70 C-5s at a total cost of $14.4 billion. This option is still
more than $10 billion cheaper than completing the C-17 program, which
the CBO estimates will cost $24.7 billion."

Sorry, I was nine billion off. The C-5s would be ten billion cheaper.

Well, California voted overwhelmingly for change, right?
The argument to continue military programs just to support jobs is
a poor one. It's kept quite a few bases open that should have been closed
years ago, wasting billions of taxes.

Also, note that the VAT in Canada, called the GST, was always
there in a hidden form as a manufacturers' wholesale tax.  It
was reconfigured to be visible, and is not a new tax ... but
retailers taking a free price hike during the transition did
make it a new tax *in practice* until some prices finally did
get rolled back when the private sector quietly realized that 
they had shot themselves in the foot (at least relieved that
the Tories took the heat, not themselves --- but the writing
was on the wall).

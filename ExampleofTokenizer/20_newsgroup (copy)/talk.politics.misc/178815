A little comment here:

Please DON't use the term "Koreshians" when referring to the Branch Davidians.
The term Koreshians is already being used.  It is the name of a now non-exist
'cult' formed in the early part of this centuary by a Cyrus Reed Teed who
renamed himself 'Koresh'.  He formed a religious group called the Koreshian
Unity which believed that the Earth was Hollow & WE lived on the inside.  The
were formed in Chicago, but left to establish their 'New Jerusalem' in Estero
Florida.  The group was fairly successful, but soon died out as they believed
in celebacy.  The last member died about 5-10 years ago.

The Koreshian were a pretty intersting group.  Today their community is now
a Florida State Historical Site.  A local historical group sponsors two 
festivals every year their which coinsides with the cult's two festivals.

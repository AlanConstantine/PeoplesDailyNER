And not only that, but if the drugs were legal we could have pharmacists instead
of pushers selling them, and the pharmacists could be obligated to not only
inform the purchasers of the dangers of drug use, but also show them how to use
the drugs in relatively safe ways.  And the dangers of impurities (responsible
for much of the suffering that drugs cause) would be all but eliminated.

      The operation going on in Somalia is a peacekeeping/peaceenforcement
      operation where force may be used.  It is not a war.  It is also legal
      under international law, which is higher than US law.  The operation
      is occuring under the ageis of the United Nations.  Can't get a higher
      authority than that on this earth.

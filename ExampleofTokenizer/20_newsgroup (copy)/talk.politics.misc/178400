Roughly one-half of Noam Chomsky's slim volume "Pirates and Emperors" is
devoted to pointing out the terrorist nature of the (legally and morally)
unjustified bombing of Libya, in just these terms.  Alas, Chomsky is too
truthful to be permitted to write for the major US newspapers.

Chomsky has also been saying this for many years, but it is far too moral a
principle for the US government to follow.

It's actually quite simple. We sell Drug Use Licenses to anybody over age
18 who wants one.  Costs $100 and you're required to attend a week of
night classes on the effects of drugs on the human body. At the end of the
class, you sign an informed consent waiver acknowledging that you've been
told that drugs are bad for you, but you want them anyway. In doing so,
you giver up ANY right to state-paid medical care for whatever might
happen to you as a result of doing drugs, or any right to collect welfare
or unemployment should you lose your job as a result of using drugs. You'd
also give up your right to drive a car.  

Anybody caught using drugs without a license has a choice; pay a $1000
fine and accept a backdated drug user's license, or go to prison.

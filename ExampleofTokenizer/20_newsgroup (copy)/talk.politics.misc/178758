# #    Male sex survey: Gay activity low

# #    A new natonal study on male sexual behavior, the most thorough
# #    examination of American men's sexual practices published since
# #    the Kinsey report more than four decades ago, shows about 2
# #    percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and
# #    1 percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual.

# #    The figures on homosexuality in the study released Wednesday

# 
# 1) So what?

Homosexuals lie about the 10% number to hide the disproportionate
involvement of homosexuals in child molestation.  They also lie
about "10%" to keep politicians scared.

# 2) It will be interesting to see the reaction when 2.5million queers
#    gather in Washington DC. After all if there are only 6million of
#    us then this is an event unprecidented in history...

But many of the people who will be marching aren't homosexuals, but
other members of the leftist agenda.

# #The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners.
# #The median number of sexual partners for all men 20-39 was 7.3.
# 
# Don't forget that 25% had 20 or more partners....

Not surprising.  Remember, that study includes homosexuals as well.

# #Compared to the table I have already posted from Masters, Johnson,
# #and Kolodny showing male homosexual partners, it is apparent that
# #homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general
# #male population.  
# 
# And what did this study show for number of sexual contacts for those
# who said they where homosexual? Or is that number to inconvient for
# you....

It wasn't published.

# #It's a shame that we don't have a breakdown for
# #straight men vs. gay/bi men -- that would show even more dramatically
# #how much more promiscuous gay/bi men are.
# 
# Fuck off

Typical homoseuxal response.

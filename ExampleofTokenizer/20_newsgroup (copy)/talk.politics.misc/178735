No, because I don't like the weather back East. However, it would bother me
not one bit to live in an equivalent area here. By the way, do you KNOW what
the extra exposure to radiation from TMI was?

O.K., in the U.S., tell me about some of these deaths and some of these
unliveable areas. Oh, and if you manage to find some of these unliveable
areas, tell me what percentage of the total US land area they are.
(Hint - the total waste produced by all nuclear reactors in the US can be
safely stored in the area of three footbal fields.)

There are actually people that STILL believe Love Canal was some kind of
environmental disaster. Weird, eh?

These opinions are MINE, and you can't have 'em! (But I'll rent 'em cheap ...)

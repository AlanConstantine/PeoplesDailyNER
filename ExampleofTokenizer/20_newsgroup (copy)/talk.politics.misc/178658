There is something terribly wrong, however, with a culture which
condemns, attacks, and all too often kills any of its members who
attempt to get an education.  My mother is an elementary school
teacher, and she tells me that she and her african american collegues
are frustrated to tears by the fact that any african american child who
attempts to do well in school and get an education is accused by
his/her peers of "trying to be white", and is beaten, bullied, and
tormented by them.  It goes beyond each passing grade on a test earning
a beating.  In my mother's school, one of the most promising young
students, who happened to be african american, had her throat cut by
one of these young thugs.

Nobody who buys into such a culture has any hope of being anything but
poor and/or a thug and/or dead, regardless of their color.

What has to be changed is the culture.  If that culture can't be
changed, then those african-american kids who are willing to separate
from it *must* be separated from it and the murderous thugs of whatever
color.  Otherwise, future bright young african american girls who
wanted to be doctors will end up dead on the school bus.

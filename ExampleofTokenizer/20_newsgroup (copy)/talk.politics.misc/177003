Tsk. Surely you don't wish for the Democrats to destroy our beloved country
just so your party can get some trivial political advantage? That's rather
a petty way to think. (Not that this pettiness doesn't extend all the way
to the U.S. Senate, I've noticed...)

While Bush was president, I kept hoping and praying that he'd wise up. I
couldn't stand the man, but I wish he'd done a decent job; if so, we might
not be in the mess we are now, and that would be a small price to pay for
suffering through another term of Republican control. Similarily, YOU should
be hoping and praying that Clinton does a good job. Even if you're certain
he won't.

   "...so I propose that we destroy the moon, neatly solving that problem."

If I have confused two different stories, it was an honest mistake but I do
not see why it becomes an exageration of either.  They both took place and
are both equally disgusting behavior for any country, let alone one that
brags constantly about democracy.

If more of YOU PEOPLE would speak out instead of just hiding your disgust
in the closet,  we wouldn't be having this discussion.

Having said, you have my heartfelt thanks and admiration for even saying
what you have said already.  I suspect, you will be getting more  hate
mail than support.

Thanks,

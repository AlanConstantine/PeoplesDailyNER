You have perhaps heard of the Dead Sea.  I may be wrong, but I believe
it is not misnamed.  And I don't believe that humans had a hand in it,
although it is possible since the great cedar forests of Lebanon were
but a memory by the time of Christ if not earlier.

But, more on the point, while Nature is the may be the more prolific
"despoiler", Man is certainly the more creative.  We have to our
credit pesticides and heavy metals, not to mention radioactivity,
which is so wonderfully persistent and fatal (not that we invented
radioactivity or heavy metals, we only concentrated them so that they
would be a more lethal threat).

In general I find Mr. Bacon's arguments rhetorical, devoid of sense,
and therefore trivial.

BTW, is there any reason this discussion is on phl.misc?

So long,

Not quite.  First, the median does not imply that half of the men are
above and half below 7.3: it simply means that 7.3 is the mid-point
between the maximum number of partners and the minimum (which is most
likely zero).  However, assuming your implication to be more-or-less
correct, your final result is still invalid.  If 50% of *all* males
have had more than 7.3 partners, and you deduct the assumed 1% of 
homosexual males, what remains is not 49.5%, but still *50%* of all
*heterosexual* males.  Which is to say: hey, we're all human.

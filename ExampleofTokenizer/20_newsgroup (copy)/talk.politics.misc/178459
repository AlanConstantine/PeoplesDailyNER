No one is questioning whether Mr. King is black.  The question arises
whether King's race should make police officers "afraid as hell."  Your
statement seems to imply that cops should have a different standard for
large black guys than for just large guys in general.  

That two posts later you don't understand why anyone pointed out your use
of the adjective is almost as informative as your original use.

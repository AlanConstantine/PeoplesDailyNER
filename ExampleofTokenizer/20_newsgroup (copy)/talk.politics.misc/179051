I have indeed heard of Pythagoras, but I don't know that he was ever
disparaged as a "bean eater".  In the American Southwest and West
(e.g., Texas, California, Colorado), the term "bean eater" is
sometimes used as a slur against those of Hispanic heritage (generally
Mexicans, in those parts) -- much like how the Irish in the Northeast
are perceived (by some) as voracious beer guzzlers.

                  STATEMENT OF PRESIDENT CLINTON


I am deeply saddened by the loss of life in Waco today.  My 
thoughts and prayers are with the families of David Koresh's 
victims.

The law enforcement agencies involved in the Waco siege 
recommended the course of action pursued today.  The Attorney 
General informed me of their analysis and judgment and 
recommended that we proceed with today's action given the risks 
of maintaining the previous policy indefinitely.  I told the 
Attorney General to do what she thought was right, and I stand by 
that decision.

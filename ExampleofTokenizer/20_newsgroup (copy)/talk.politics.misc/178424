     For several reasons, including:

     - With the current rate of growth of population and considering the
       60 million people who are already living there, the oil reserves
       won't last for more than 30 years, and after that Iran has to have
       other sources of energy.

     - Even with unlimited resources of oil, it is the most wastefuls and
       foolish way to burn the oil just for thermal energy, while thousands 
       of valuable derivatives could be taken from oil. For example, I
       bought an iron for $11:00 here in Canada, later I bought a garbage
       bucket for our kitchen for nearly $12:00!!! The bucket has been made
       from  petroleum products, and I bet the producing country has not
       received even 5 cents for the amount of the oil used in that bucket,
       while the western producer, thank to the monopoly they have in 
       technology and are trying to maintain it in all fields of science by 
       methods you saw in that program, makes billions of dollars every
       year.

     - Iran's hydro-potential is something around 10,000 MW which won't be
       enough in less than 10 years. Even exploiting this potential takes
       billions of dollars and so many years, which can not catch up with
       the rate of growth in Iran's energy production.

     - More important than all above, the science is not the belonging of any
       specific group or nation. It is none of anybody's business if a nation
       want's to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, if that nation has
       accepted international monitoring, something which Iran has done.

      You can do whatever you want to. But fair people of the world won't 
  accept any of your screams, when they see the constant observations
  of IAEA from Iranian sites, and their constant rejection of the idea that
  Iran has a nuclear bomb production program.

>hahahahahahaahah!

     Good sense of humor! Since you have been sleeping during past few
  years, I remind you to look at all Iran's neighbors from Kashmir and
  Afghanistan, Tajikestan, to Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Iraq, Lebanon,
  Palestine, boreder between Saudi Arabia and Qatar, etc. to see that only
  Iran is in calm and peaceful situation. Also, look at Iran's stance with
  regard to Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, war between Armenia and Azerbaijan,
  civil war in Afghanistan, etc. to understand what " wise and calculated
  approach" is all about.

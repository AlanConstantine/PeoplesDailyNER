Hello?  What the Sloan decision means is that the tax protestors 
were wrong.

Demonstrate, please!  The rules of procedure make this very 
unlikely.

FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY

Which makes it legally unsound.  If I were representing Mr. Teel, 
I'd try a procedural approach if I could find one, or recommend 
he plea-bargain.  He's setting himself up to be in hot water.

HOW NOT TO WRITE A DEED

One case involved the construction of a conveyance to grantees "jointly, as 
tenants in common, with equal rights and interest in said land, and to the 
survivor thereof, in fee simple. . . . To Have and to Hold the same unto the 
said parties hereto, equally, jointly, as tenants in common, with equal rights 
and interest for the period or term of their lives, and to the survivor thereof 
at the death of the other."

The court held that the survivorship provision indicated an intent to create a 
joint tenancy.  Germain v. Delaine, 294 Ala. 443, 318 So.2d 681 (1975).

But aren't you imposing your moral standards against gay people because
you do not want to rent to, or hire, or as you put associate with, (
and I do not know of a law that requires you to associate with gay
people)?  It works both ways.

All people want to have an equal opportunity for all things that
lie in the public domain.  It will be a gigantic step forward when
people take other people based upon ability and talent, rather
than skin color, eye color, height, weight, sexual orientation 
(and I use this last one as meaning gay, bi, straight, let's not
go off on the tangent about pedophiles, rapist, etc.)

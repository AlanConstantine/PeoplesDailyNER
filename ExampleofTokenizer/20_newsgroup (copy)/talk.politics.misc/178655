Gosh, I have to associate with heterosexuals against my will every day! 
That means you've imposed your moral codes on me, now doesn't it? 
Fortunately, I have taken the time to get to know some members
of the het community and discovered that, hey!  They really AREN'T all evil
elitists with no concept of reality!

I've got a few clues for you.  (a) I'm not working to pass any laws.  (b)
Our morals are YOUR morals: I imagine you value freedom.  So do we.  If you
value your own freedom, you must necessarily accept that these laws are
important to protect it.  After all, discriminate in one area and you're
open to discriminate in the rest.  (c) I suggest learning a bit more about
gays, lesbians, and bis before you post the kind of drivel you have been. 
It's obvious that you haven't a clue who you're talking about.

But not between members of the same sex, right?  How can you live with such
hypocrisy?

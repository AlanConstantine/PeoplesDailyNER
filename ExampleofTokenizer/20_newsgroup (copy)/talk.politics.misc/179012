Pssst....Let me let you in on a little secret.  Clinton is not responsible for
the death and injuries that took place in the Mt. Carmel "camp" on Monday.
Neither is Atty. General Reno.  The issuance of tear gas might have not been
the best idea to achieve the extrication of the Branch Davidians, but
previous attempts through negotiation had fallen through and the FBI had 
said that this was to end asap.

One person and one person ONLY is to blame for this. Vernon Howell aka David 
Koresh. It was he who issued the order to start shooting at the BATF agents 
when they went to serve the arrest warrant on Feb 28. It was the Davidians 
who KILLED four law enforcement agents, and injured several others. It was 
Koresh who refused to peacefully walk out of the compound and fight out the 
legalities in a court of law, with a jury of 11 citizens. (note: I can't say
a jury of his peers, as his writings indicate that he thought that he was 
Jesus. It would be pretty difficult to find that many self-appointed prophets 
in the North Texas area.)

As for who started the fires in the building, there have been numerous local
news reports with interviews with some of the rescued people stating in fact
their own people were starting the fires.  Once again, it wasn't Reno, 
or Clinton who lit the matches in this. It was Vernon Howell. The only people 
in the building I feel sorry for are the children who perished in the blaze,
as they had no choice in the matter. The rest of them had every chance.

So Steven, please scrape up your pennies and nickels and go buy yourself a
clue.


Tom

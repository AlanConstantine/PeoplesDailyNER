Do it in private, and it won't be a problem.  But the reason that
the homosexual activists are so hot on antidiscrimination laws is
that they want:

1. To be able to wear that lovely chiffon evening gown to work, and
not have people get disgusted;

2. To be able to wear their NAMBLA T-shirt and not worry about
getting fired;

3. To be able to have access to young boys, so that they start
making the next generation of homosexuals.

If your right to privacy is what makes sodomy laws unconstitutional
(a position that I agree with), then keep it private, and there
won't be a problem.

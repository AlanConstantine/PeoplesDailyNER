Oh, you foolish person.  I do know what the fuck I'm talking about
and will gladly demonstrate for such ignorants as yourself if you
wish.

The legalization of drugs will provide few if any of the benefits
so highly taunted by its proponents:  safer, cheaper drugs along
with revenues from taxes on those drugs; reduced crime and reduced
organized crime specifically; etc, etc

If you would like to prove how clueless you are, we can get into
why - again a lot of wasted posts that I don't think this group
was intended for and something easily solved by you doing a little
research.

Making you look bad is too damn easy.  The vast social and historical
differences between alcohol and other drugs make this comparison
worthless.

And so it shall be if the government (by the people) decides that
these vices are detrimental to the society as a whole.

The overwhelmingly vast majority (get the point)
of AIDS cases are contracted thru behavioral CHOICES.  Nuff said.

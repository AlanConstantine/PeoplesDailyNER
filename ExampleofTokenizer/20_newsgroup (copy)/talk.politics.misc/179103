I think that Phil needs to get out a ruler and see exactly how big 50mm rounds
are - roughly 2" diameter.  The type of stuff used in Anti-Aircraft gunnery.
.50 calibre is much smaller, but the 3000m effective range (~2mi) sounds about
right. Maybe he just got the two confused..... The FBI's reasoning was sound,
but the note from PH-B was factually wrong.

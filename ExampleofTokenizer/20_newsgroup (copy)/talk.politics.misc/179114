I don't expect to be hired based on my sexual orientation.  If someone
decides he wants a gay-only staff of employees, that's his business.
I won't force him to hire heterosexuals; please don't force me to
hire homosexuals.

No.  I'm saying it's none of the government's business what two
consenting adults do in private.  You don't believe that, unfortunately.

And you are yet another reminder of the emotional instability of
homosexuals.

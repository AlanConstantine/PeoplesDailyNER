	I dont know.  The usual practice would be for the government
to confiscate the children and put them into the "system".  After they
are deprogrammed of course.

	The government is capable of incredible evils in the name of
"Child protection".  Much of the time "Child protection" concerns
itself with protecting the child from its natural parents.  Once its
in the "system", the government's concern for the child tends to 
go to zero. 

	It may not be as bad as Roman behavior, but it could hardly
be described as "kindly"....unless your a believer in the intrinsic
goodness of the government.

	Would you please define "nth derivative of debt"?  Last time I asked
you seem to have disappeared....

	And it's the deficits themselves that came down to 2.9% of GNP.  The
numbers are posted in the previous posting.

	Paul, like many others, is confusing the deficit with the debt.

	Not in terms of GNP, the one universally accepted measure of deficits
(at least among rigorous economists :)

	Semantics.  Lindsey proves otherwise.  Taxes make people change their
economic activities.
	Or shall we debate whether it is the gun, the bullet, or the person who
does the killing?

	Or whether this gentleman can win the same praise as Lindsey. :)

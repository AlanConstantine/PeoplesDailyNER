It's not what they did that matters.  It's what *you* do and
what *I* do and what *we* do in response that matters.  Do we
lessen ourselves by killing in response to killing?  It's
vengeance.  That's all.  It's no deterrent.  It serves no
purpose but to slake somebody's blood lust.

Yeah yeah yeah... and sure would be nice if we didn't apply the
death penalty disproportionately to minorities.  I'll revisit my
opinion on the death penalty when there are more whites up for
it than blacks.  I.e., when hell freezes over.

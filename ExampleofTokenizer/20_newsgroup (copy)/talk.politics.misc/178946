Gee, the War on Drugs has been going on for all these years and they're
still getting drugs!  Imagine that...

My friends who like grass (I don;t agree but it's pretty harmless) are
unable to get it, yet I know a number of places where someone stupid
enough could get crack cocaine within a half hour of leaving my office.

The War on Drugs has been completely unsuccessful, yet it's lead to really
horrible abuses of peoples' COnstitutional rights.  I don't see how a
thinking person could justify it.

   This is hilarious.  Here we have a self-described libertarian 
   getting all sentimental over a religious and national entity
   not exactly known for respecting individualism.   In somewhat
   more detail it should be noted that the whole concept of a 
   religion, and especially a patriarchial one like Judaism 
   (or Islam, or Christianity) is obediance to rules and authority.
   Leviticus, Deuteronomy, etc are FULL of "thou shalt"s and "thou
   shalt not"s.   And of course Israel's concept of human rights, while
   no doubt better than places like Syria's or Iraqs, is hardly the 
   stuff to warm the cockles of a libertarian's heart.

Scuse, please, are you under the impression that this argument is made in
a vacuum, and that somehow only the fetus' potential life is being considered?

I would guess, from your 'very egocentric' comment that you do not, in which
case I have to ask just what the hell is wrong with egocentrism when one is
making a fundamental choice about one's life?  Don't *you* consult *your*
*own* wants when *you* make decisions about your life?  I haven't noticed you
asking *me* about what *I* want from you....

I've got some *great* ideas.  If egocentrism is ruled out, you can show up
tomorrow 8am and I'll put you to work.

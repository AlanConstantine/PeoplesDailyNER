First of all, I wouldn't have gone after the Davidians for a firearms
violation which I object to in the first place.  Second, I wouldn't
have executed a search warrant via an armed assault when all the
Davidians were sure to have been there.  Third of all, I wouldn't have
cut off all outside communication to Koresh.  And I certainly wouldn't
have gone in with a tank-- time was on the FBIs side.  Since they had
outside resupply, they could wait indefinitely.

Just say NO to police searches and seizures.  Make them use force.

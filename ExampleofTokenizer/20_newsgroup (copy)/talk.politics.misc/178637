My two cents:

It is a sad, sad day. I *never* thought I'd be defending religious
people (especially extremists), but I *am* mourning the murders of
David Koresh and his followers. I believe they deserved the right
to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, and the right to worship
as they saw fit. Those rights (and the lives of innocent men, women
(some pregnant), and children) were sacrificed to save the Federal
Government from being embarrassed. Had the Branch Davidians taken
their case to court, the black eye the BATF earned themselves would
have been multiplied many times over.

I also mourn the deaths of the BATF agents although the deceptions
carried out against them by our government were nothing compared to
the atrocities against the Branch Davidians.

Attorney General "Vampira" claims to have made the best decision she
could based on the information she was given. This is possible. Officials
in higher positions than hers have been duped. We have no choice so
we may as well give her another chance. Even if she is truly evil,
it is doubtful that she'll kill more than a few hundred at a time.

I'm considering joining the NRA.

Finally, I have one question: What happened to the Federal agents that
had supposedly infiltrated the Branch Davidians' organization (and
started this whole debacle)?

Well they could unseal the original warrent (Why was i sealed in the
first place?), release their video & tapes (from their listening devices
inside the compound) and quit makeing contradictory statements.

Do you believe their statement that the children were killed by
lethal injection?  They later stated that the childrens bodies
were burned to the point the would be hard to identify.  So
how did they come up with the lethal injection theory?

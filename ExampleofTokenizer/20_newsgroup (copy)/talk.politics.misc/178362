Oh, no, not in this case. I've noticed that you conveniently edited out your
stupid comment that the PRC stands for Cambodia. When we're arguing the
Vietnam war and about Cambodia, and you toss in a boner like that (along

Oh, and even the Vietnamese agree that they did far more damage to
Cambodia than we ever did.

These opinions are MINE, and you can't have 'em! (But I'll rent 'em cheap ...)

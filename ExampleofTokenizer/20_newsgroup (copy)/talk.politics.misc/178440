	More "gridlock" talk from another relic of the past.  The
Selective Service system creates jobs and is an investment in 
the future of america......and whats wrong with that?

	We need jobs because at this point in the recovery, the economy
should have generated 10 billion jobs and since it has not, the
government has to step in and help.  Shutting down selective service
would cost "good jobs" and we can't do that.  

	What we really need is to involve selective service in a more
closely directed manner.  We need the selective service involved
in environmental protection, high-speed rail, commuter aircraft, 
civil rights, national service and health care.  Every dollar
we put into selective service now will get us $10 less spending
in future.

	I really believe now to think about it that selective service
is long-past due for the creation of a cabinet position.


	Your not beyond hope, just get back on america's side and
start doing your part for change.  What Bill needs from you
now is support for the economic stimulus and health care reform.
You need to devote all your energies to fighting gridlock and
supporting change.  Get on the team.  After all, the evil has
been banished from washington and the time for complaint 
is past being neccessary.

	And remember, Bill Clinton cares.  He may someday even have
a town meeting in your city.  If your an appropriate sort of 
person, if you phrase your questions properly and show the
proper respect and awe, you might have the chance to ask Mr,
President your question in person.

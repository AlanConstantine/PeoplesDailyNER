Wrong.  It's possible to inherit a debt.

See above.

The Constitution is not a contract.  It is a statute.  Please, 
Mr. Teel, or anyone, show me one case where the U.S. 
Constitution, or any state constitution, is considered a 
contract.

It is also designed to delineate the powers of the U.S. 
government.

I can't wait.

HOW NOT TO WRITE A DEED

One case involved the construction of a conveyance to grantees "jointly, as 
tenants in common, with equal rights and interest in said land, and to the 
survivor thereof, in fee simple. . . . To Have and to Hold the same unto the 
said parties hereto, equally, jointly, as tenants in common, with equal rights 
and interest for the period or term of their lives, and to the survivor thereof 
at the death of the other."

The court held that the survivorship provision indicated an intent to create a 
joint tenancy.  Germain v. Delaine, 294 Ala. 443, 318 So.2d 681 (1975).

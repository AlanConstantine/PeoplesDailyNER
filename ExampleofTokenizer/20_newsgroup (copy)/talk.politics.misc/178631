never heard of arguement by absurdity, eh no?  Also called
sarcasm.  The usual procedure is to accept some part of the
'oppositions' arguement and run with it until one goes
beyond 'rational thought' and then ring the changes.

z.B. The idea of a minimum wage is considered a good one.
And in these times of economic difficulty, the Washington
legislature is propossing to raise the State MinWage from
$4.25 (the federal level) to $4.90 (fifteen cents over
Oregon's).
	It would seem to me that this increase does not
keep pace with inflation, that the minimum wage should be
to $6.08 by my figures, so it is proposed that we raise
the minimum wage to $6.50 per hour by 1 July and then give
a 10% cost of living increase every 4 July.

and anyone who doesn't like it is obviously a country club
republican getting rich off the exploitation of poor people.

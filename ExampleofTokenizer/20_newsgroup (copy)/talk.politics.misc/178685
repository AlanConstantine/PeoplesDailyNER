And as an agnostic who's slightly aware of the Mormon Wars that Casper
describes, I'd side with him on this. Not that I support the Koreshians, nor
do I support the Mormons, but in a nasty sense, the major difference is
this; in 1857, the Mormons kicked the U.S. Army's ass. In 1993, the
Koreshians died in an inferno. Chances are, if things had turned out a
little differently, we might have Koreshians posting to the Net a hundred
years from now talking about some future, analogous event.

"Well, I'll know right away by the look in her eyes
she's lost all illusions and she's worldly wise, and I know
if I give her a listen, she's what I've been missing, what I've been missing
I'll be lost in love and havin' some fun with my cynical girl
Who's got no use for the real world, I'm looking for a Cynical Girl"

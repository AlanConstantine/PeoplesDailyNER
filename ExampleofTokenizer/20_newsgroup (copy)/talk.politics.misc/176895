You mean they passed a law that does nothing at all?  No enforcement
mechanisms?  As usual, you are wrong.

Yeah, right.  I guess the next time a homosexual complains about
sodomy laws, I can just echo your stupidity about "democratic
processes" and he won't have any basis for complaint.

# No it isn't.  No it isn't. No it isn't and it depends on the subset
# (note *subset*) of abuse you look at.

Repeating it three times makes it more correct?

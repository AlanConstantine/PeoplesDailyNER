Can people please stop the 'I think/know the BATF/FBI are completely
responsible but they'll cover it up so that the investigation will
show that Koresch is responsible' bs. In an investigation of this
size with the feds, state, and civilians involved in the
investigation it would be practially impossible to cover up.
And with Republicans like Arlen Spector calling for investigations,
this isn't going to be handled with kid gloves.

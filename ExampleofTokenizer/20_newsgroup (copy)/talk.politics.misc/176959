Good to see your still out there WDS. Surely we've
been around the ring enough by now, that you know 
you can't spin me up with expletives. 

Let's see if there's anything left worth responding to...

Seems right in character to me -- creature of the state. 
Btw, are you still happy with your presidents?

See the part about the children following the "and" in the first line
above. 

As to a connection, your "cult" is "faith in rules".

Sure. My concern is the well being of the children.

{Interesting that you would respond "emotionally" in defense of the 
government. Maybe there is a beating heart there.}

For the record though, the biggest-baddest goverment on earth claims 
the most sovereignty over man. Best I can tell God allows anyone to
go to hell who wants to. Omnipotency logically determines that "allowing"
and "sending" mean the same thing.  (Mere human concepts of course.)

So come on WDS. Why bother to try some flimsy facade of logic. Waco
proves it's not needed -- the demonstration that government can walk
over it's own rules in the name of justice has been made. No problem 
by me. Noted and announced -- for the record. Just giving the govern-
ment it's due, and getting back to more worthwhile non-government 
concerns.

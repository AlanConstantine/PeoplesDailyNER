Your point is well taken.  I heard him on TV last night.  Sometimes I
forget to not believe ANYTHING the FBI/BATF says.  The problem is that I
generally expect better from the FBI than from the BATF.  Unfortunately,
the FBI seems so desparate to deflect ANY criticism of themselves that
they are grasping at ANY straw, no matter how thin.

I saw in the "Cleveland Plain Dealer" this morning a report that the CEV
crew threw CS *CANNISTERS* into the Davidian house.  I KNOW from
personal experience that burning type devices start fires.  I certainly
put out enough of them in the pine forests of Ft. Benning in the summer
of '80.  I'd like to know if they really threw burning CS grenades.

   News Advisory:

   Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala will speak
to the 16th annual AFT Paraprofessional and School-Related
Personnel Conference at 8 p.m., Friday, April 23, at the
Washington Hilton.  Shalala will discuss HHS's agenda for helping
children over the next four years.
   AFT's Paraprofessional and School-Related Personnel Division
includes school workers such as paraprofessionals and teacher
aides, school bus drivers, school secretaries, school custodians
and maintenance workers and school food service workers.  More
than a thousand school employees will attend the conference which
is being held at the Washington Hilton, April 23-25.  Most of the
school workers attending the conference come from urban school
districts where child health and nutrition, welfare reform and the
availability of Head Start and other preschool programs are major
issues.
   Workshops scheduled for the conference include sessions
addressing issues around reauthorization of Chapter 1; how
paraprofessionals and school-related personnel, especially
minority men, can serve as student role models; the increasing
problem of school violence; dealing with abused children; and
assisting children with serious health problems.
   For a complete conference schedule, contact Jamie Horwitz
at 202-879-4447.
   The American Federation of Teachers represents 805,000
elementary and secondary teachers, paraprofessionals and
school-related personnel, higher education faculty, nurses, state
and municipal workers.

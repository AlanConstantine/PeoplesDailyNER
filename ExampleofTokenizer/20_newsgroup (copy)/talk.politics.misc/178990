Has this video been made public?  The FBI spokesman also said they 
first knew of the fire when black smoke started pouring out, but
later said that *three* different FBI agents saw B-D members starting
the fires.

Also the FBI claims to have listening devices (bugs) in the compound.  
Will they make public the tapes of what the B-D said?

Well sealing the initial search warrent, keeping the media miles away,
not letting the B-D talk to the public, making contradictory statements,
not releasing the vidio & tapes are not steps to ensure public confidence 
in their actions.

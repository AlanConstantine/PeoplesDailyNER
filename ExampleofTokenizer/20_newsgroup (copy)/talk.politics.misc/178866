Why are you all playing these pathetic number games?  The number of people
showing up at the MOW hardly constitutes the entire queer populace.  I doubt
that it constitutes more than a handful of us.  I'm queer, and I won't be
there, simply because I don't have the time or the transportation.  What the
hell makes you think the participants in the MOW embody more than a minimum
number?

Face it, people, we're everywhere.  There are always more of us than you
think.  Our numbers are constantly GROWING, not diminishing...some of your
children will grow up to join us.  Hell, some of MY children may grow up to
join us.  The best way to deal with this phenomenon is not to fear it and
blind yourself to it, but to realize that you have nothing to fear.  We're
not perverts, we're not dangerous, we're just here, and we're human just
like you--er, most of you.

Idiots like Cramer and Kaldis can rant all they like.  It won't do them one
iota of good.

P.S.  I still can't get over the fact that some people actually believe that
every queer in the U.S. would show up at the MOW, and that these numbers are
meaningful.  And, come to think of it, what about those of us in OTHER
countries?  Tree.

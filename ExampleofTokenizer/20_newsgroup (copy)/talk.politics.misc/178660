  Well it may not have saved them (but they were Xians so they were
  already "saved").  But it did save the taxpayers the expense of a 
  nasty trial (there's a budget deficit on, you know!).  Not to mention
  the costs of extending the seige any longer.  And it saved the local
  fire depratment the trouble of having to be on station when the feds
  started their little action.  And it saved the BATF/FBI the embarrassment
  of a lot of nasty testimony and accusations by BD's.   And let's not 
  forget how it saves future job-seekers and college-admission-seekers 
  from having to compete with all those kids in the compound who won't
  be growing up to work or go to school.   <sarcasm mode off>

  But it doesn't save you guys on the net from having to hear me say,
  "I told you so!"    Whether Koresh started the fire or the feds did
  the bottom line is the same:  there's a whole lot of dead children 
  who would be alive today if they had been released back when we were
  debating this a few weeks ago.

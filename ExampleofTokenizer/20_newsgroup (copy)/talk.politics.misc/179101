	Actually, that is not quite accurate. Avraam's lawyer has been quoted as
claiming that Avraam says the fire was started by a tank knocking over a keroscene
lamp. Avraam HIMSELF was quoted today in the Washington Post as stating that
he overheard the following words on the second story of the compound before
jumping out a window to safety -

	"The fire is lit".

"When up a dangerous faction starts,         "My opinions do not represent
With wrath and vengeance in their hearts;     those of my employer or
By solemn League and Cov'nant bound,          any government agency."
To ruin, slaughter, and confound;             - Bill Riggs (1993)
To turn religion to a fable,
And turn the Government to a Babel;
Pervert the law, disgrace the gown,
Corrupt the senate, rob the crown;
To sacrifice old England's glory,
And make her infamous in story.
When such a tempest shook the land,
How could unguarded virtue stand ?"
- Jonathan Swift (1732)

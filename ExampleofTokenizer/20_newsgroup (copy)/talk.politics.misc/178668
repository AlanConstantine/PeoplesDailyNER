Is anyone out there knowledgeable on drug issues in Japan?  I'm interested
in knowing if Japan has or has ever had a problem with drugs, and how they
dealt with it.  I've heard, undocumented, that Japan years ago used heavy
legal penalties to end a serious heroin problem.  I'd like to know both
sides of the story.  Does anyone recall such a problem?  What were laws
at the time relating to drug use, drug dealing, and drug trafficking?  What
are the laws now?  What other anti-drug measures, like education and treatment
has Japan used?  How are drugs regarded by the Japanese people?  How effective
have anti-drug measures been in Japan?  Thanks for your help.

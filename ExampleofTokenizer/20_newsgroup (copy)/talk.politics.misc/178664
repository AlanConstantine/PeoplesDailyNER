Mr. Cramer, when are you going to stop indulging in such blatant lies?
This is not only not true, you know damned well that it's not true.  None
of your research supports this; no mental health expert has taken this
position.  This is *your own* opinion which is not backed up by any
research or any knowledge.

According to one survey, done in San Francisco, the number of heterosexual
men who were molested as children was on the order of 5%.  The number of
homosexual men who were molested as children was on the order of 8%.
Source:  a book on sexual abuse of children by David Finkelhor (sorry,
the title escapes me).

Conclusions that can be drawn from this:  none.

Oh, you definitely have a choice.  You realize, of course, that you
are approaching the two-year anniversary of your crusade.  How are
you planning on celebrating two years of lies?

Incidentally, we are still waiting your crusade against African-Americans,
women, and other minorities who also want to "impose their morality on
others".  After all, they also want the government to "tell peaceful
people how to live."  Therefore, you really "have no choice", but to
continue to point out that being a woman or an African-American is not
a lifestyle, but a sickness.

It's bullshit, Mr. Cramer.  It was bullshit when you began this crusade
and it's still bullshit.  I am continually amazed at the depths to which
you'll stoop to carry on this deliberate attack.

Janet Reno killed the Waco children.  She is responsible for
their deaths.  She should resign immediately.  She should have 
understood that David Koresh was a madman who would do anything
against the children if he became provoked.  All the warning 
signs were there and she ignored them.  She provoked Koresh
into killing the children.

The situation in Waco was similar to a hostage situation with 
a madman holding a gun against the head of an innocent person.
In such a situation, a person who provokes the madman and causes 
him to pull the gun's trigger is responsible for the death of the
hostage.  Janet Reno blindly stumbled in there and basically
threw a tear gas container at the madman hoping that he would
release the hostage.  It's no surprise that the madman would
pull the trigger in response to that kind of provocation.

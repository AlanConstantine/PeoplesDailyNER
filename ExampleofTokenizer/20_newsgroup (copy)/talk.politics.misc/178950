	Or, if the phone comany charges you as if you did, you could always

	a) start your own company
	b) use a different phone company

	But we're talking about the government.  Some want item 1, others item
2, etc.  There will always be something someone doesn't want to fund.

	You don't like abortion?  Work to recriminalize it.  But as long as it
is legal, you really don't have a chance in getting funding stopped
(permanently).

	What scam?  I'll never have a hysterctomy (sp?) but it's a legal
procedure and my health insurance company will pay for it.  Shall I now argue
that I should be exempt from those fees?
	Great, exept now I'll pay more since it's primarly men who have
prostate procedures.  Not to mention the extra cost of keeping track of who
wants to pay for what.

	If it bothers you that much, start your own health insurance company
that doesn't pay for abortion.

	This is a free country, you know.

	So don't get coverage through that company.  Simple.

	No, but I imagine you'd have them pay to fight wars, wouldn't you?

	So don't buy health insurance from that company.  Simple.

I was quoting a news story.  I have no idea why they claim this was
the most "through examination."

WHAT?  Even in San Francisco, the Dept. of Public Health estimates
that only 11% of the male population is gay.  What you are claiming
is that of the 16 million people in the NYC and LA areas, that more
than 10% are gay.  What is the source of your numbers?  Keep in
mind that attempts by CDC to determine homosexual percentage in
American cities have given numbers <3%.

# 1% of the American male population is about 1.25 million.
# 
# So what this study says is that all gay males live in New York City or
# Los Angeles, and about half-a-million people are lying about being gay.

Yes, your 1.75 million number smells funny.

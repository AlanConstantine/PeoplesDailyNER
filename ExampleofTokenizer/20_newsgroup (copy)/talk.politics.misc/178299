Jobs?  What the hell have jobs to do with it?  It's another touchy-feely 
program from the new, vapid administration.  The fact is, the major claim
made for "universal" immunization -- that "all children will be immunized" --
has absolutely no validity.  Several states already have U.I. programs, have
had these programs for _years_. The result: on average, their success rates
are no better than the national average.  It seems that the gummint hasn't
yet figured out a way to MAKE parents bring their kids in.  Yet another case
of shameless demagoguery from the "new" Democrats, the "agents of change."

What?  Clinton using this issue for _partisan gain_?  Do tell.

All together now... c'mon, you know the words... "Meet the new boss! Same as 
the old boss!"  And the chorus: "We won't get fooled again!"

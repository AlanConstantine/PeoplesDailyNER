Drive down to Cincinnati and take a look.  Not pretty, is it?
Things were much better there in 1980.  All that growth went into
the hands of Ron and Georgie's pals, and I DIDN'T GET A SINGLE
DIME OF IT, DAMMIT.  And, now, I'm gonna be bled to death by tax
leeches to pay for the damage.  F***ing great.

Oh, here's another thing.  Seems like a lot of people in 
Columbus drive over to Marysville and make Japanese cars.  Hm.
I wonder how many American-owned companies employ those in
Central Ohio?  Other than Ohio State University.  :)

Hmm, you still don't get it. Then again, I'm not posting from a  University
where the hue and cry was raised against "Jewish physics".

Tell me, committed any anti-semitic acts today? What kind of boots do you
wear?

And still -- Libertarians want the State out of their lives. Parents are very
capable of protecting their children against the predations of pedophiles,
which, BTW, you still haven't disassociated yourself from.

Are you, or are you not, a member of NAMBLA?

There are actually people that STILL believe Love Canal was some kind of
environmental disaster. Weird, eh?

These opinions are MINE, and you can't have 'em! (But I'll rent 'em cheap ...)

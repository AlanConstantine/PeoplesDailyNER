Of course, then there's the other side. An article in yesterday's Atlanta
Journal stated that there are many scientists who have misgivings that the 
data being used to determine whether or not global warming is occuring is
faulty. The point that the article made is that all long term temperature
dataa collected has been in urban areas, and that any heat rise can be
attributed to the growth and urbanization of the area. They called it
the "asphalt temperature trend". We have no real long term data on remote
areas, such as the middle of the Amazon rain forest, or the top of Mt. Everest
or the Gobi desert, for that matter. An accompanying article mentioned that
a group of scientists at NASA had developed a method for using a satellite
to collect temperature data globally, and that preliminary results showed
a slight downward trend attributed to the Mt Pinatubo eruption. It went
on to say that even with the current downward trend, there appeared to be
*NO* change in global temperatures using trend prediction methods for at
least the next 50 years.

I can quote the article verbatim if you like..

  True.  Today's Boston Globe interviewed a former Unification Church
  leader who is now a consultant on cults.  He said the FBI's approach
  was totally wrong.  He said they should have tried to break down the 
  BD's loyalty to Koresh through psychological means.   Koresh's whole
  theology was based on an approaching confrontation with the forces 
  of evil in the world and a seige mentality based on this.  The Feds
  played into his hands **PERFECTLY**.   By surrounding the compound
  with tanks and playing loud rock music and glaring lights at them 
  they strongly reinforced Koresh's message that the outside world was
  evil and threatening.    He said instead they should have set up 
  a picnic atmosphere, and acted inviting and friendly.  If they
  broadcast anything over PA systems it should have been loving 
  relatives reflecting on pleasant events from the cult members'
  childhoods.   The idea is to make the outside world and surrender
  seem like a pleasant, desirable alternative.   Interesting comments.

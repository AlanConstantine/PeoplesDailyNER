In article <15218@optilink.COM> cramer@optilink.COM (Clayton Cramer) writes:
#Yet, when a law was proposed for Virginia that extended this 
#philosophy to cigarette smokers (so that people who smoked away
#from the work couldn't be discriminated against by employers),
#the liberal Gov. Wilder vetoed it.  Which shows that liberals don't
#give a damn about "best person for the job," it's just a power
#play.

Of course Clayton ignores the fact that employers pay health
insurance, and insurance for smokers is more expensive than for
non-smokers.

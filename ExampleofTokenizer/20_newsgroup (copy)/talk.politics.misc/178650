lightly off track, but still relevant: why all the crying
over the children?  I know we are hardwired to consider
the future of the race, and comapssionate people are concerned
for all children; but so what?

For the Branch Davidians, the options were to die or
submit to Evil[tm] - and have their children's very
souls lost due to the brain washing of the Ungodly
State.  (to put this in terms the 'average' netter might
	grasp: they considered it the equivalent of putting
	Jesse Helms in charge of NEA _and_ MTV.)

And remembering that in 1983 the Supreme Court Struck Down
Freedom of Conscience (IRS vs Bob Jones et al.):

Who's next?

Is your religion / belief system Government Approved?

Jim JOnes had won numerous awards from the state before
he moved to Guiana?  Obviously state regulation would have
stopped that tragedy too.

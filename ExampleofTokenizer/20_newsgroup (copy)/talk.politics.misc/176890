] Sorry, Rohit, but you are responding to someone well-recognized as a
] flaming nut, i.e., Clayton Cramer. He must have been abused by a man and is
] living his life in an attempt to vilify all men who like sex with other men
] something slightly similar to the way his assailant liked it with him. He
] will alter or misrepresent anything he finds to try to prove that there are
] homosexuals who wish to rape little boys like he was coming out of the
] woodwork. There is no hope for him. In all probability he is secretly gay,
] which compounds his neurosis in his own mind, by thinking that someone else
] made him that way. I don't personally see how someone like him could walk
] and chew gum at the same time, as mentally crippled and dominated as he is
] by his fantasies.

] homosexuals do some huge disproportionate amount of child sexual abuse,
] even though he insists that there may be as few as 1% of them in the male
] population! If there were that few of them in the population, San Francisco
] would currently be empty, because a significant portion of them have sought

Sorry, but I don't see how the response applies to what was posted.

Unless I am badly mistaken, Rohit is suggesting that protecting boys
from men is different than protecting girls from men. There are situations
in which boys and girls are apart from members of the *opposite* sex
(due to social convention or whatever) and thus are safe (in at least
some sense). These same situations don't (necessarily) protect the
children from abuse by members of the *same* sex.

If we can understand that, it's not such a tremendous leap to suggest
that if we all think about it hard, *someone* may come up with a
practical solution (or even a partial solution) to some of the situations
in which children are made vulnerable to homosexuals who wish to abuse
them. By working together "with good will on both sides", we may be
able to start solving problems without restricting anyone's freedoms.

Mr. Walz on the other hand is using Rohit's post as an excuse for
personal attacks on Mr. Cramer. While Mr. Walz hasn't (by a *long*
stretch) been the only one to flame Mr. Cramer, it is no less childish
and it only serves to weaken any other arguments he may make in the
future.

According to the latest of CNN reports, one BD said they started the fire
themselves, and one said the FBI did it.  Now, given the choise of two,
which do you belive?  It's hard to answer, but add that to the latest
reports (again from CNN, if I remember correctly), that several kersone
containers were inside the compund, make me believe the first guy.

Me too.  We'll see if it comes up.  More info on the "listening devices"
is coming on CNN now...I can't keep up with all this.  Though, the FBI
says that they heard no plans of a mass suicide.

After the initial fiasco where the ATF went in with guns blazing, I seriously
doubt the American public would care much for the "assassination" of two 
people, no matter what they were doing.

See above.  One BD admitted that they started the fires themselves.  It's
possible he's lying, but I don't see what the BD's would gain from that.
It only implicates them more.
   Granted, it's very weak evidence, and everything is going to be in
a different later on.  But for now, there is more evidence to suggest
that the FBI *did not* intentionally destroy the BD's, which is what the
initial poster claimed.  Again, as more information becomes available,
things may change.

I'm not sure I understand that last sentance...can you re-state it?

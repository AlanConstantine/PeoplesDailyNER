	Well, this is still the land of the free for the time being. Individuals
are supposed be able to do what they please unless it infringes upon the rights
of someone else. Owning FULLY automatic machine guns is also permitted by
law if you have a CLASS III FEDERAL FIREARMS LICENSE and have paid the transfer
tax. If you are refering to the .50 cal the feds claim the BD to have had, 
I have used .50 cal for 3000 yard target shooting. It a legitimate and 
challenging sport.

	Ah, I see Mr Spock! How logical! Well, again, this is the USA and
we have had a long tradition for standing up for individual freedoms and
liberties. That is what is written in the Constitution, If you dont like it,
then find another government where the citizens are its slaves. You'd
like it there with that philosophy of yours.

	No, you right. You'd probably not be breathing! Especially since
I intend to encourage her to learn how to handle a handgun!

	A threat to whom? He was out in the middle of nowhere waiting for
the Apolcalypse. His neighbors even said that he never bothered anyone!
Who can you justify your statement?

	One of these days, you too will pick up a firearm and learn to use
it and you will defend your Second Amendment right, knowingly or not, willingly
or not. The statistics are not in your favor.
	In this age you must support the liberty of the individuals. If not, 
then this nation is condemmed to a totalitarian regime. Orwell's 1984 is
comming true, only ten years late.

"...when all government ... shall be drawn to Washington as the centre of all
power, it will render powerless the checks provided of one government on
another and will become as venal and oppressive as the government from which
we separated."

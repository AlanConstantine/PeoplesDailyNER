Bigots aren't classified as deviants?  How sad.

: Sexual deviants do not comprise a "political minorit[y]".

So, what's this I hear about a March on Washington...assuming

as subsets of "sexual deviants?"

: > and if she had any shred of self-respect, she'd be out the door.
: I only associate with girls who do indeed have self-respect.  

I trust that many self-respecting *women* might take some sort
of offense to your use of the term "girls" in the above sentence.

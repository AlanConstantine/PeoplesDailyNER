I know it was used several times in the south, to prosecute the murders of
blacks, after all white juries had cleared the accussed.

I believe it is a general charge, that is no specific right is mentioned.

The SS has previously ruled that since the seperate governments were in
essence seperate sovereigns, then double jeopardy does not apply.

(If this is true, then could defendents also be tried under city and
county governments?)

This mornings paper said that the ACLU has decided to reinstate its
opposition to this kind of thing. They had earlier suspended their
opposition while they examined the King case. There might be hope
for the ACLU after all.

I am, at long last, going to replace my beloved 512ke.
I am looking at a new LC III and a used IIci.  Prices
have yet to be worked out, so I'm just thinking right now
about their merits and drawbacks.

Here's what I've thought of:

The IIci has much greater potential for expansion, a la NuBus and
greater memory capacity.

The LC III would be new, under warranty, newer ROMs (is the IIci
"32-bit clean"?), and would have sound input.  I also like the
"pizza-box" case.

Performance-wise, I have read that they are almost identical, the
LC III being a little slower.

So, which should I get?

Summary: Results of IIsi clock modification poll
Keywords: IIsi,clock,poll

This poll was conducted to help users decide whether or not to alter their
IIsi clock oscillator. I have attempted to gather as many case histories as
possible to find some estimate of success and risk. The number of replies
probably shows how rare this modification is but give the impression that
success rates may be higher than the previous 80% estimate. 24 of 24
machines were able to run at 25 mhz when no add on boards were present.
This is not a scientific survey but it is the best we have to work with.

Thanks to all who contributed to this poll. 


Issues:

	Speed) 25 mhz to 27.5 mhz appears to be the norm for machines without
		add on cards. All reported machines were able to use
		25 mhz as long as no add on cards were present. Several Apple
		Nubus cards were in use. No machine with the Nubus adapter
		was able to go faster than 25 mhz. One wasn't even able to
		achieve 25 mhz with the Nubus adapter in place
	
		At speeds of 32 and 33 mhz, the startup sound is distorted and
		hi density floppy disk problems have been reported.
		
		Note: Unless specifically listed below, machines were not
			tested with a higher speed clock to failure. Hence,
			the 25 mhz operational machines may well work at
			higher speeds.
			
	Damage) One user reported pulling out the plating of one pad. This was
		repaired and the machine is operational. One other
		reported pulling the pin out of the original clock oscillator
		during desoldering. There is one second hand report of a user
		putting a gash in the motherboard with a slipped soldering iron.
		
		No reports of static discharge damage.
		
		No reports of high speed operation causing damage.
		
		Then again, I also don't have any reports from users of
		defective parachutes.
		
	Add on boards) Compatibility appears to be a problem with Apple Nubus
		Adapters. Several other add on boards have been used with
		success. See case histories
		
	Heat Sinks) Virtually all modified machines had a heat sink installed.
		These were often the TO-220 style power transistor type. Some
		used epoxy. Some used a dab of heat sink compound with a dab
		of cyanoacrylate glue. There was also use of a clamp with a
		bolt through the hole in the motherboard.
		
		
		
Case Histories:	

All speeds are the effective CPU speed (1/2 of clock oscillator). All reported
CPU versions were 20 mhz.

    No FPU or other add on card
    Heatsinked CPU only
    On 24 hours/day
    No damage during installation
   
2)  27.5 mhz operational without Apple Nubus adapter. 25 mhz top speed with
	Apple Nubus card installed
    Heatsinked CPU only
    On 24 hours/day
    No floppy problems
    No damage during installation
   
3)  27.5 mhz operational. Unable to boot at 31 mhz
    Heatsinked CPU only
    No floppy problems
    No damage during installation

9)	25 mhz operational.
	PDS adapter with a Spectrum 24PDQsi graphics card and a 
	VideoSpigot, a 20MHz FPU
	Heat sink on CPU
	
10)	25 mhz operational. 33 mhz failed after several hours.

The Logitech ScanMan 32 is a nice unit, compact and effective it will
bring in graphics with surprisingly good quality. Note that its effective
resolution in grey scale mode is only about 72 dpi. If you don't intend
to magnify a graphic, it works fine. A true 256 level gray scanner would
work better for images.

I've seen the ScanMan go for as little as $100 used. It is a reasonable buy
at that price. Higher end hand scanners are almost as expensive as used
flat bed scanners. Here is Seattle, the paper shows occasional good bargains
in the classifieds. Used color flat beds have been seen as lows as $500 lately.
Grey scale flatbeds come in around $300-$350.

   Here's my system desc:
   4 megs on the main board, 1 on the accelerator board
   mac -plus, with the most recent roms (D)
   trying to run system 6, but would like to run 7
   the hard drive is a jasmine, works fine if i start up with the 
	accelerator disabled
   i also seem to get the problem of when i try to start up from floppy
	with the hard-drive disconnected, all i get is the disk loading,
	but the screen is black, except for a happy mac in the middle,
	and it never gets anywhere
-Jason

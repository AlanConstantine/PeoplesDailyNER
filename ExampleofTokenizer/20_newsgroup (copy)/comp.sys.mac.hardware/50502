I've had the board for over a year, and it does work with Diskdoubler,
but not with Autodoubler, due to a licensing problem with Stac Technologies,
the owners of the board's compression technology. (I'm writing this
from memory; I've lost the reference. Please correct me if I'm wrong.)

Using the board, I've had problems with file icons being lost, but it's
hard to say whether it's the board's fault or something else; however,
if I decompress the troubled file and recompress it without the board,
the icon usually reappears. Because of the above mentioned licensing
problem, the freeware expansion utility DD Expand will not decompress
a board-compressed file unless you have the board installed.

Since Stac has its own product now, it seems unlikely that the holes
in Autodoubler/Diskdoubler related to the board will be fixed.
Which is sad, and makes me very reluctant to buy Stac's product since
they're being so stinky. (But hey, that's competition.)

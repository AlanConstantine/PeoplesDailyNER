	I have a Northern Telecom disk array dated 1987 that has two 253MB drives
units in it and I cannot get it formatted.  I set the SCSI ID on 1 and my
software recognizes the unit, but I cannot mount it or anything - do I have
to use BOTH drives in the array? 

	Any help with these drives or possibly newer software than what I'm using
(FWB HDT1.0 and 1.1) will be greatly appreciated!

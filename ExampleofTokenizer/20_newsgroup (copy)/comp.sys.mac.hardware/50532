It would also be great for another reason - when not docked, it could serve
as an ARA server to the large internal HD, your corporate email, etc.  In
a pinch, you would also have two machines, instead of 1.5.

If they could couple that thought with RocketShare, and let you use both the
'030 on the PB and the '040 on the dock, it would be a mighty powerful dock.

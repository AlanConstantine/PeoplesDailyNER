I'm not an expert, but having spent much too much of my life looking for
the power switch, or the brightness control, or the de-gauss, etc., etc.,
etc. it is my firm belief that the only reason any
controls/switches/knobs/whatever in places where they are hard to reach is
because the designers put them there deliberately.

The real question is weather this is because of stupidity, or
maliciousness.

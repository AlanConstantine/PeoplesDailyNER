The Partition button in Apple's HD Setup lets you set up A/UX and other
types of partitions. It WON'T let you create more than one normal mac
volume. You need SilverLining or something similar to do that. It WILL,
however, allow you to take advantage of some possible unused space on your
hard disk, if you don't mind reformatting the whole thing.

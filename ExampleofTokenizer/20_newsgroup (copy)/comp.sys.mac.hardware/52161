I have a IIsi & a portrait display (and I love it).  I'm using the
built-in video support, so its slow and deals with 16 colors/grays.
So, I'm wondering:  if I get a video card, how much does this tend to
speed up things and will I be able to get more than 4bits?  Oh, I have
CombiCache w/FPU.  Does this limit my choices of video cards?

Thanks

I have a Logitech 256grays hand scanner from a PC.  I'm wondering if anyone
has been successful in connecting the scanner to a mac?  It has the same
connector and is a serial device on the pc.  I can imagine the pins coniguration would need to changeed, but I'm not sure if the signal levels would be correct,
and if the mac s/w would work with it.  

Of course the manuals say nothing about the interface, connector layout or
anything H/W-ish!

Any ideas??


thanx,

Steve

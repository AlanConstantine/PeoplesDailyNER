Hi.

He needs insert the MO before FileSharing get turned on, and the only one
that can see the disk is the owner of the machine. (I'm not sure but seems
that the check "Allow owner to see entire disk" should be enabled too).

A bad thing: you can't eject the disk until FS is turned off.

Hope that helps.

Ok I want to get a color Mac I don't care if it is an LC or a Mac II or
what but I want to go to a color machine.  I'd prefer to trade my
present Mac SE system plus some cash or other equipment for the color
system as right now I'm not full of the $$$ to buy a color system
outright.
Here's what my Mac SE system has...

Mac SE 4/20 with internal 800K drive
20 Meg external
External 800K drive
ImageWriter II with 4 color ribbon

Stuff that can go with it......
I'm willing to include both of the 9600 modems and the 2400 baud modem
if the deal is right.  Keep in mind that both the 9600 modems are less
than a month old and the MultiTech modem sells for about $440 or so.

MultiTech Multimodem II (9600 data/fax)
U.S. Robotics Sportster (9600 data)
Microcom QX/12K         (normally will connect at only 2400 as highest
but it will do faster if connected to another Microcom)

The USR and the MultiTech are both brand-new

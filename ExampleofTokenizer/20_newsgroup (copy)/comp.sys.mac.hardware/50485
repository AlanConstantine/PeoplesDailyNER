	Well, I just got my Centris 610 yesterday.  It took just over two 
weeks from placing the order.  The dealer (Rutgers computer store) 
appologized because Apple made a substitution on my order.  I ordered
the one without ethernet, but they substituted one _with_ ethernet.
He wanted to know if that would be "alright with me"!!!  They must
be backlogged on Centri w/out ethernet so they're just shipping them
with!  

	Anyway, I'm very happy with the 610 with a few exceptions.  
Being nosy, I decided to open it up _before_ powering it on for the first
time.  The SCSI cable to the hard drive was only partially connected
(must have come loose in shipping).  No big deal, but I would have been
pissed if I tried to boot it and it wouldn't come up!
	The hard drive also has an annoying high pitched whine.  I've
heard apple will exchange it if you complain, so I might try to get
it swapped.
	I am also dissappionted by the lack of soft power-on/off.  This
wasn't mentioned in any of the literature I saw.  Also, the location
of the reset/interupt buttons is awful.  Having keyboard control for
these functions was much more convenient.
	Oh, and the screen seems tojump in a wierd way on power-up.
I've seen this mentioned by others, so it must be a...feature...
	Anyway, above all, it's fast.  A great machine at a great price!

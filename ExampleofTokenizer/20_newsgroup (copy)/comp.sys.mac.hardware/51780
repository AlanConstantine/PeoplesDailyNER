	I just bought a select 300 and rushed home to print 
some grayscale pictures for my kids, when I discovered that
grayscale(and photograde) are not available if you are
using an SE...even if you are running with an '030 cpu.
You won't see this in the printer's docs, and the Apple
rep didn't mention it to our users group either. It seems
that SE ROMs won't support those "features". Okay, I 
guess I should have somehow known that this was the case.
Let the buyer beware, huh Apple?
	Be that as it may, I have been thinking about the 
problem and I'm puzzled. Why  can't a defencieny in the 
ROM be made up for in software. I write software for a living
(on unix platforms) and I don't understand the "it just
can't be done" responses I've gotten from those I have
asked so far.  Isn't Mode32, or somesuch piece of  soft-
ware, just such a fix. 
	Anyway, I was hoping someone knowledgeable
about Mac internals could set me straight: is it simply
impossible for a mac SE to print grayscale, or could
someone armed with enough info and a little pro-
gramming experience cook something up that would
supplement the ROM's capabilities?
	Also, how does one know if one's mac can
support the grayscale and photograde that the Select 300
is supposedly capable of? ( Short of buying the printer
and trying it out like I did)
	Thanks for your help.

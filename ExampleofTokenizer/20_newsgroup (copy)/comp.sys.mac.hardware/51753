Summary: 486 box with NEXTSTEP


First of all:  Thank you everyone who replied.  As you can well
imagine, I got nearly one hundred responses, so I figured I'd thank
you all here instead of individually.

The tallies:

I got one vote for A/UX, which runs on the Macintosh.

I got several nays for Commodore's 3000UX system.

Most people agreed that SGI's were nice, and very very expensive.

Some (devoted) Sun users nearly insisted that I try to find a used
Sun, say a 3/60 or 3/80.

About a dozen people told me how they love their NeXT...only now NeXT
is out of the hardware business (see below).

And most of the other 85+ people said:  Get a 486 box, and run some
version of Unix that's available either in the Public Domain or
commercially.

=============

And so I weighed my options.  What stood out, in my opinion, was that
there were several different versions of Unix available on one system:
the 486 (PC) architecture.  If I bought a Sun, I'd have to use SunOS.
If I bought a (used) NeXT, I'd have to use NeXTSTEP (see below).  Ad
nauseum.

But with a PC, I can run Linux, which is a small user-friendly (?)
flavor that uses shared libraries to cut down on volume, although I
hear its networking abilities aren't up to speed with 386bsd, another
PD (==free) port (which takes up a lot more space).  I can purchase
BSD386 (commercial product) if I choose.  There are several other
commercial packages available.

So, what I've found out (after pricing systems, etc.), is that I can
get a really good Unix workstation for as little as ~$2500.  Including
source code!

Or, for ~$3500-4000, I can get an unbelievable EISA bus 486-66DX2
system, fully blown, and run single user BSD386.

What I'm really excited about, though, is NEXTSTEP for Intel.  NeXT
changed into a software company only, and they are releasing their OS
for PC's.  I've used NeXT's before, and I absolutely loved them.
Everyone who wrote me about NeXT (or NEXTSTEP) commented on the
developer's environment, and how well designed the whole package is.

===========

So, my choice is to:

1)  Wait for the mail on Monday, so I can read what NEXTSTEP's system
requirements are

2)  If I'm wowed on what they say, I'll buy a system that fits into
their criteria

    2a)  Get NEXTSTEP

3)  If I'm wowed, but I can't afford it yet (most likely), I'll buy a
system that fits their criteria

    3a)  Get Linux or 386bsd, as a temporary learning experience so I
can save up for NEXTSTEP

4)  If I'm not sufficiently wowed (least likely), I'll buy a system
that is slightly less blown out (like a 486DX 25, ISA) and put Linux
or 386bsd on it.

================

Again, thanks to everyone around the net.

I had the same question for my 55lb NEC 5FG monitor. The Apple guy said that
their 50lb 16" monitor is OK to put ontop of the Centris and had no coment
beyond that. I was going to just put the NEC on the box but then I got to 
thinking - the monitor has a small tilt/swivel base so maybe the weight
would be more concentrated than with Apple's (I don't know the area of the 
base of their tilt/swivel). Additionally, the CDROM drive is in the middle.
So I cut a piece of 3/8" thick wood to about 16.25" x 12", covered it in a 
cream covered cloth, and used it as a buffer layer between the Centris's top
and the monitor!!

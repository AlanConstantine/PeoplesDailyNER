I recently aquired a Quantum Q250 harddisk. It is a 50 meg 5.25"
mechanism. It is SCSI. I have a few questions and a few problems. First
there seems to be an extra connector socket on the back that I can't
figure out what it is for. The address is set by some jumpers on the
bottom so I don't think it is for that. Any ideas?

Second, it would be nice to get a hardware manual for the drive. There are
a lot of jumpers on it that we don't know what they are for.

Third, I have got the drive to format. It took a while to get things to
work and most of it is fine for now. The formating initialy was
troublesome but seems to be ok. The main problem is if you do a reset on
the MacPlus the drive disappears. If I shut the mac off and then back on
agian then the drive comes up fine. Any ideas.

Please reply to one of the email addresses below.

Thanks

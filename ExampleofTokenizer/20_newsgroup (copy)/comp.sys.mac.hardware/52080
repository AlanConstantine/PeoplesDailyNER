Anyone have a price quote/vendor for the vx to centris 650 upgrade?
I've been quoted a price of $2401 till August 15th after which it will
cost $2732.  This of course doesn't include the trade-in rebate of
$1300 for the vx board.  Thus for $1101 one gets a Centris 650, 8 meg
onboard with both the FPU and Ethernet.  Anyone else have any info?
This price is from the University of Illinois micro-order center, are
there any other vendors who offer similar prices?

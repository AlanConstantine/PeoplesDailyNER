Hello all.
	I am thinking about buying an external monitor for my SE/30 and was
wondering if anyone out in netland has any advice for me.
	I am mostly thinking about a 14" color monitor and an 8 bit card that
can switch between 640*480 and something higher (like 800*600).  I read an
old report on a card from Lapis that could do this, but could not use the
external monitor as the main screen (with menubar) which to me is a major draw-
back.  Has this perhaps been fixed? Or can any other cards do this (like the
Micron Xceed) ?
	Also which monitor should I buy?  At the moment I am leaning towards
the Sony 1304, 1304s or 1320 (what exactly is the difference between these?)
but are there any other good cheap monitors I should know about?  Doesn't the
monitor have to be multisync to support cards that can switch resolutions?

Please send me e-mail and I'll summarize.

I would also greatly appreciate getting the e-mail addresses of any mail order
companys that sell monitors or cards.

Thanks in advance

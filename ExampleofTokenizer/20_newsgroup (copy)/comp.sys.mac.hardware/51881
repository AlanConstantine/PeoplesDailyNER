ha... all this talk about changing the clock speed of the q700 makes me ask??
 if i replaced the 8mhz 68000 in my plus with a 16mhz 68000 with a 16mhz
clock occilater of its own( not shared by the rest of the mac... just the new
16mhz68000)  would my mac work..... and if it would work.. would you think there
where be any problems with sound, vidio,scsi........

it seems like a simple solution to keepa dead slow mechine a
live a little longer..
   Oh if this would not work any idears on how to make it work???
		thanks

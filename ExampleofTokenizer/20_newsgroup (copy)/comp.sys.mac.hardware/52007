I have a 3 month old that seems to have acquired the jitters of late. 
The 14" Apple color monitor that I'm using with an LCIII sort of jiggles to
the left and right all the time now. I have attempted to relocate the monitor
to make sure the problem isn't interference from something else, but the 
problem seems to remain no matter what I do.

Has anybody encountered this problem?

Thanks,

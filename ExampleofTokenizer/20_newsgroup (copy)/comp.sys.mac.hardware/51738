For the most part, this is a bunch of bunk.  I've got a Computer Engineering
degree, yet I've spent the last 7 years writing software that people actually
use.  Moreover, the salary distinctions are incorrect; I received 3 job offers
upon graduation; the two jobs that actually used my hardware experience were
$7000/year lower!  My advice is to decide which classes and projects most
interest you, and pick the major that allows you to take them.

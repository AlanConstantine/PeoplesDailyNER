Hello,

we need the code for decompression of Quicktime JPEG Pict files, as they
don't conform to usual jpeg compressors, which are available in source.
The code should be in C Pascal or Modula. The code will be used on several
platforms to view pictures over ISDN. Perhaps a special hardware will be
put around it (much less then a mac! perhaps only a DSP with some support
chips)
If the code is not available, perhaps the algorithm is available to
decompress
them.

===== This is a posting for my friend who does not have USENET access ========
===== Please contact him (not me) directly, thank you ========================

1. The Mac II is supposed to have a socket for the MC68851 PMMU chip. Could
anyone let me know where that socket is on the motherboard. I have obtained
a PMMU chip (16 Mhz) from a surplus store, and would like to install it onto
my Mac II (circa 1987). But I cannot see the socket myself when I tried to
install it.

2. Could anyone send me the pinouts for the Mac II SCSI DB-25 interface?


Thank you.

I have a question for y'all:

I'm looking at an ad for the new 3.5" FAST SCSI-2 drives from Micropolis
in the June, 1993, MacWorld. (I have seen similar ads for the IDE versions
in IBM PC magazines)

Well, the ad says that all three drives have a FAST SCSI-2 interface,
but then it says that the DTR rate for each drive is 5 megabytes/second,
*max*.

How can this be?  I thought that if a drive was to be FAST SCSI-2 it
had to have a DTR of 10megs a second?

(I am assuming the 5megs/sec claim by Micropolis is from the 512k cache.
I admit that I would be very impressed if the drive can *read/write* data
at 5megs a second!)

Thank you.

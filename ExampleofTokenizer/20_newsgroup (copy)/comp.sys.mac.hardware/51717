I  have one of the original Powerbook 170's (with 4Mb of Ram) and find
that 4Mb is a drag when trying to do my work.  So, what is the best way
to get the maximum RAM for this unit, and what's it going to cost me?
I'm hoping I can get the latest and best info from real users by posting 
to this group.

Thanks in advance,
--Bill

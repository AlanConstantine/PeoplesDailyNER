I have a mac plus with 2.5MB RAM. I have just bought an extra 2MB so that
I can have the max 4MB RAM that a plus supports. However, I can't get it
to boot after I install the 2 extra SIMMs. Instead I get a sad mac (Sorry,
but I can't remember the code). Looking at the motherboard, I can see
that 2 resistors have been snipped off where it says "256Kb path -
1 row". I assume that was done when the first 1MB SIMMs were added.

So, my question is: Are there any other resistors that need snipping? 
				or, Do I have bum SIMMs which need to be exchanged?

Any and all advice will be appreciated.

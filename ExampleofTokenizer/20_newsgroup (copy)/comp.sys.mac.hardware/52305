  Giday netters!  Just got a used Newlife 25 accelerator, with FPU, and i 
was wondering about a few points.  
-Anyone know the current driver version for it??
-Can it handle the 16-bit grayscale card, if i get the video option
-Why would it be hating my hard drive?(can't use the accelerator and 
	hard drive at the same time). Do i need a new driver on my drive?
	What make?
-Thanks,
	Jason

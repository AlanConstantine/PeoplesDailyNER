Hi all:
Thanks to you all who have responded
to my request for info on various kinds of fax modem.
I'd like to ask a few more questions.
1.  What are the advantages of buying a global village
Teleport Gold over other cheaper brands like Supra, Zoom etc?
2.  I heard that both Supra and Zoom use the same software.
Why are there so many complaints about the incompatibility problems
of Supra?  What kind of incompatibility is it?
3.  If I decided to buy the Teleport Gold, is there any
possibility to add a voice option in the near future?
4.  Has anyone heard of a possible voice option that Supra will offer
this coming summer?
5.  A person did mention a new AT&T modem.  Is it
getting good reviews from various Mac Magazines?
6.  If I want the best, fastest, most economically sound and
possible voice option, what fax modem should I buy?

Sorry for posting so many questions, but I think they're necessary.
I promise to repost any answers if they're not already posted by a responder.

Thanks so much in advance.

Regards,

Thian.

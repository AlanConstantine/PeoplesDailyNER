Sounds about right.

If there is high demand for a product there is little incentive to
aggresively cut prices.  Once the demand fall off a bit, then is the
time to start getting aggressive with pricing.  Waiting too long can
really hurt your business though :-)

The PowerBooks have sold very well up to now, if they are slowing
down Apple needs to come out with some lower priced versions (the
only reason I own a PowerBook is that I could spring for a $900 PB100,
the rest of the lineup is way to pricey for me).  I'd bet they'll
be coming out with more power versions too.

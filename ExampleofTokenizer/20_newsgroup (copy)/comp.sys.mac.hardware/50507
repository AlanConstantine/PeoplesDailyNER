Has anyone had any problems with their Duo Dock not ejecting the Duo
properly?

When I first got it, the Duo would come out of the Dock a couple of inches
when ejected, and I had to pull it the rest of the way. Nowadays (and I've
had the system for 4 months), the Duo doesn't come out *at* *all* - despite
the fact that the mechanism makes all the appropriate noises, and I have to
grab hold of it and pull it out myself. Is there a simple fix for this, or
do I have to return it to my Apple Dealer, where it will languish for weeks
while I have to make do with no colour display, no VRAM, no floppy or
SCSI etc. 

(BTW, it's not that the Duo is locked into the Dock - it just doesn't
want to slide out any more).

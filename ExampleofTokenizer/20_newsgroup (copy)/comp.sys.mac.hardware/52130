  Since Image Writer LQ was discontinued, there is no Apple Talk
  printer with 11"*15" continous paper printer.

  I would like to know is there are any possibility to connect
  an IBM compatible printer to an Apple Talk net directly (or 
  with a Net Serial hardware), and if I need any other software
  to do it.

I have no experience with this particular hardware, but
just about every month in Macworld there is an add for
an combined SE accelerator/Video board.  This item sells
for about $1000 and comes with a 25MHz 68030/68882 pair,
eight SIMM slots, and a grayscale 21" monitor.

This accelerator plugs into the SE's lone expansion port
and thus no soldering.  You will however, need a long
TORX wrench to get the case open (but that's not really
a big deal).

Does that sound like what you were looking for?

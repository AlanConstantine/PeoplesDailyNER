I have an opportunity to buy a Radius VideoVision
board for about 1/3 of normal street price, which
I believe is due to a change in the board architecture.

I VAGUELY, MAYBE remember that there was
some kind of serious problem with this board, which
does Composite, PAL, SECAM to S video, Composite,
etc coversions. Plus also generating quicktime movies, 
etc. MacWeek was generally complimentary about it
in the April 12th issue.

Does anyone have any information on this board, such as is it the 
one which has been superceeded, what about an 
upgrade if so, etc. I'd be very curious to hear from you.

THANKS!

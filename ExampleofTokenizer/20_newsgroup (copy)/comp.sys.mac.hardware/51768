How many NuBus slots do you have?

Applied Engineering has something called the QuadraLink, which is
a card with 4 serial ports that you get at through the comms
toolbox (in addition to the built-in ones) It also comes with
software for fooling applications to open an AE port when they
think they open a built-in port.

They also have a more expensive card with DMA (better performance)
and I _think_ they, or someone else, have a card that handles
8 ports simultaneously.

As I said, with NuBus, you're green. Learn how to use the Comms
Resource Manager to get at the various installed cards.

Cheers,

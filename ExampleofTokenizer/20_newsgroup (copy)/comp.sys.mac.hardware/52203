Since the demise of the Outbound company, what options would exist for me 
if I were to buy one of their laptops? 

(1) Since the Outbounds (2030, 2030E, etc) use mac plus roms, won't that 
severly limit using future applications?

(2) What is a reasonable price for one of their laptops? The prices I've 
seen seem extremely high considering the limited choices now.

(3) How reliable have they proven?

Any answers would be helpful.

Macintosh IIsi, 3/40, 80ns.
Clock-upgraded IIsi works well at 25MHZ, however, does not work with
Nubus adaptor and 1400k disk even though it can read/write 800k disk
at32MHz. Interestingly, upgraded IIsi overcomes basically the fighting
between the Vedio and the System so that CPU never be reduced below 8 no
mater whether the cache is on or off. This is pretty useful when you
use the virtual memory of system 7.

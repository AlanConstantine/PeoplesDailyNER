Hi Netters.

For my home computer I have a humble MacLC with a 12" color monitor.

The majority of my work is writing, therefore I would love to have
a b&w portrait monotor conected to the LC.  However, I sometimes do need
the color monitor.

My question is this;

Is there a good (Cheap) way to hook up two monitors to my LC
and is there anyone out there that has done this, how do you like it?

Please respond here or to me directly.

Thanks for your time, hope to talk to anyone soon!

Does System 7.X support all SCSI CD ROM drives?  Or are specific drivers
needed for each different make/model?

Specifically, I'm looking at getting a NEC CDR-25, mainly because they
are cheap.  I know its a slow drive, but multimedia isn't my interest.
I mainly want it for extracting software distributed on CD.
Will I need to get a specific driver to use this drive on a Mac?


thanks...Charles

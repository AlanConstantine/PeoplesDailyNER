My company has developed an application for the Mac that emulates a chart
recorder - virtual pen traces scroll smoothly across the screen.  As we
tested the application on a number of computers we discovered some
surprising performance differences across products.  The scroll performance
of the IIsi and LCII was better than the IIfx. This led us to investigate
Color Quickdraw performance across the Apple line.

The results:

The fastest QuickDraw color performing computer Apple makes is the
(drumroll please) LCIII.  And the Color Classic ranks right up there with
the Quadra line.  The Centris line pales in comparison.

Does anybody know the differences in these computers that explains the
disparity in graphics/processor performance?

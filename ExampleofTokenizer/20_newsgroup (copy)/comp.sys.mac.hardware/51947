A/ROSE = Apple Real Time Operating System Environment

This is a system extension for these NuBUS cards using the 
MCP (= Macintosh Coprocessor Platform). The MCP-cards are NuBUS cards with a
Motorola 68000-Processor and 512 KB RAM (expandable to 1 Meg).
MCP is a development platform for hardware-designers so they can use a card
with an own processor and thus the main processor isn't needed for these cards.
Currently the only cards I know are

- the Apple TokenRing-Card
- the new Apple Ethernet-Card
- the Apple NuBUS serial card

Perhaps there are some third-party-cards, but I don't know.

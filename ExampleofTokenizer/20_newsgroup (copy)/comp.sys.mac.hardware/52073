Hello,

I saw this question posted a week or so ago, but as far as I could tell no
answer appeared on the net. What is the good oil on connecting the Apple
Extended Keyboard to a PowerBook? The earlier questioner wonderd if this would
be too much of a load for the PB and as I want to connect just such a beast I
am curious.

I haven't got a PB yet so I can't RTFM but I assume that a standard keyboard
with a mouse would be ok as the spec sheet I read mentioned connecting an
external keyboard. But is the Extended plus mouse pushing it?

Any help gratefully recieved. I will summarise to the net if necessary.

Thanks, John Collins.

P.S. I am thinking of a PB160 but I assume that this would apply to all PB's.

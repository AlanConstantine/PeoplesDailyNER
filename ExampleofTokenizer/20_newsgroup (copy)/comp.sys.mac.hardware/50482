Greetings!!

	I'm planning to upgrade my Mac IIsi:

		(1) from the present 5Megs to 17Megs;
	and	(2) add a Math-Coprocessor.

	Technology Works, of Austin (Texas) comes quite highly recommended by 
some Mac magazines.  I was just wonderring if anyone could share with me 
anything about Tech Works (both good and bad experiences); or give any advice
about other mail-order companies that I may consider.

	Your reply would be very much appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

Sincerely
Peter Choo

Saying things like that incline one to believe that you can't get it (SCSI)
to work for your setup (too bad). I've daisy-chained 4 SCSI devices off my
mac without a problem (limit is 7 SCSI devices in the daisy-chain). If it
isn't working for you, it's really better to state the problem (unless all
you really intend to do is try to get nasty e-mail, in that case perhaps you
would be better off posting to alt.masochistic type of newsgroup).

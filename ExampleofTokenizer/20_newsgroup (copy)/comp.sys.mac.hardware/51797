Dear Netters,

My sister has an Apple 12" Color Display hooked up to an LC.

Problem:  There is an annoying, horizontal, ghost-like stripe that 
precesses vertically about once per second.  It is about 1 cm high.
She is in grave danger of going insane because of it.

Any ideas of what it might be and how I might cure it for her?

PS: if I pick up the display (I thought it might be RFI from the LC) it 
seems to get worse!

  I've got a Racet 5.25" MO Drive with a Ricoh RO-5030E mechanism with the
new ROMs... The thing is, I have a new TOSOH Optical Disk 512/bytes per
sector cart for the thing that refuses to mount or be formatted... all the
carts that I have for the drive that work are Racet Certified Media
512k/sector carts... All I can think of is that this TOSOH cart uses some
kind of incompatible low level format... anyone know what software will
allow this to be formatted on this drive? or a new DIP setting for the
mechanism? I've tried just about every combination of drivers and custom
formatting programs I can find with no luck... any ideas?

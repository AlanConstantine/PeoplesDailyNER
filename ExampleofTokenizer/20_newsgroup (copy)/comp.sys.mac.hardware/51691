Ok I want to get a color Mac I don't care if it is an LC or a Mac II or
what but I want to go to a color machine.  I'd prefer to trade my
present Mac SE system plus some cash or other equipment for the color
system as right now I'm not full of the $$$ to buy a color system
outright.
Here's what my Mac SE system has...

Mac SE 4/20 with internal 800K drive
20 Meg external
External 800K drive
ImageWriter II with 4 color ribbon

Stuff that can go with it......
I've got 3 modems and I'd be willing to give 1 of the 9600's and the
2400 with the system

MultiTech Multimodem II (9600 data/fax)
U.S. Robotics Sportster (9600 data)
Microcom QX/12K         (normally will connect at only 2400 as highest
but it will do faster if connected to another Microcom)

The USR and the MultiTech are both brand-new

If interested send me e-mail at dleonard@wixer.bga.com

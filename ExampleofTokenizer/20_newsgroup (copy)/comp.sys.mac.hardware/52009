	I've been getting seemingly random disk accesses on my Centris 610
with a Quantum 240 LPS, but this is NOT the regular recalibration it has been
doing since I got it....  This is sometimes short, sometimes long, accesses
that sound like there is some read/writing going on.
	I have SAM 3.5, and Disinfectant 3.0, but neither picks up anything..
Any ideas?

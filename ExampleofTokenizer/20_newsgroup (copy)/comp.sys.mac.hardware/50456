The kit is for an already existing Laserwriter IINTX. It is a ROM
upgrade that replaces the font rasterizer code with the more
efficient, speedier code that first became available in Adobe Type
Manager 1.0.

That software came out after the original NTXes and the so-called
ATM rasterizer is now standard on Postscript printers.

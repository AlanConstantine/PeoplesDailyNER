I remember reading a thread a few days ago that mentioned removing an external
syquest drive from its case and dropping it in the internal drive of a Centris.
. . I was going to do that with my 610, but had a couple of questions.  My
PLI 80M syquest drive has a wire from the drive to an id# switch on the
outside of the case.  Where do I connect this switch??  Can the computer just
"tell" with internal drives?  
	I noticed that the drive will lay over part of the motherboard (I
didn't look closely, but I seem to recall it laying over the ram that's
soldered onto the motherboard?  Would that cause problems?
	One last question!  Is there anywhere to order a faceplate cover?  
the drive's front panel is smaller than the space left in the case (the
drive's panel is the same size as the spotsBM clone's cases).  Should I just
cut a hole in the plastic panel that is currently holding tmpty place?

Ans are welcomed!  Thanks!

Here's a good one: Does anyone know of a product that allows
me to RACK MOUNT my 2CI (or maybe 650 if I blow some more
money...) ??? My application is music, and would like to be
able to haul it around (would probably plan to get an MO drive
or something so I don't have to depend on an internal fixed
hard drive - i.e., may be pretty rough on an internal HD...)

I'm in the San Francisco Bay Area, if that matters.
Also, anyone have any info on 650's and Midi? And, would anyone
care to email me with the price they paid for their 650? Or if
there's a price list FAQ, never mind... Just curious about the
difference between the best retailers and the local university
pricing...

Thanks, Jeff Adams

We were told that the resolution on the 5FGe could only go to 1024x768.

And that the 5 FG could go to 1152x870.

Has anybody tried running these higher resolutions??

Somewhere I thought I read that the 1152x870 on a 17" monitor may make the
type too small to read.

Any help would be appreciated.
Steve

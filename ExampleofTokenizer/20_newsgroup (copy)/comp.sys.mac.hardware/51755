Does anyone know if there are any devices available for the Mac which
will increase the number of serial ports available for use
simultaneously?  I would like to connect up to 8 serial devices to my
Mac for an application I am working on. I must be able to access each
one of the independently.

If such a device exists, are there are any limits to the number of
serial devices I can use?

Any information is appreciated.

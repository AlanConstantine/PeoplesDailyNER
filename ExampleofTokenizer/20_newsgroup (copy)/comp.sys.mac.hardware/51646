I have a Macc IIci and a Color scanner.
I scanned a picture at 600 dpi. When I try to print
it on my HP500 color printer, after 10 minutes of
making noise, the mac hangs. I would need to reboot it.
What does this mean? Do I need to buy more memory? I have
5.0 MB now. I also have about 50 MB of disk free, and the
scanned picture is about 12 MB.

A quick query for Powerbook gurus:
Tom Spearman, in a post on alternative Powerbook battery options
mentioned that there exist 3 versions of their Powerbook 140-180
batteries: a 2.5 amp hour one (M5545/A), a 2.8 amp hour one,
(M5545/B) and a 2.9 amp hour one (M5545/C). Anyone out there
know how to determine which of these a battery is? I looked at my
battery and there is no obvious exterior indication. I contacted
Tom Spearman who had gleaned the information from MacUser and he
didn't know either. Anyone out there know the answer?
	Thanks!

BTW, if you can reply via EMail I would be grateful. I don't
often read this newsgroup. I will post a summary of answers.

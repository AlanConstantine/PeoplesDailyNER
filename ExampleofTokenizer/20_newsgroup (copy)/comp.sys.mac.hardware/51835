Hi!
A while back, there was a thread in this group about the use of the IWII
in Europe (in countries with 50 Hz AC current).  The consensus at the time
was that the IWII would not work there.  As I will be moving there this summer,
I called Apple to make sure and they told me (today) that the IWII (as bought
in the U.S.) will definitely run on 50 Hz AC current (as long as a step-down
converter is employed if 240 V current is used).  The same info, turns out, can
be found in the IWII manual (p. 127 in the 1989 version), but I didn't really
trust that.  Does anyone have any direct experience to the contrary?  Just 
wondering.

Chris W.

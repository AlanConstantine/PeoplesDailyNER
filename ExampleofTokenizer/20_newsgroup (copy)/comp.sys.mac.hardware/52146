hello out in networld,

       We have a lab of old macs(SEs and Pluses). We don't have enough money 
to buy all new machines, so we are considering buying a few superdrives for 
our old macs to allow folks with high density disks to use our equipment. 
I was wondering what experiences (good or bad) people have had with this sort
of upgrade.

Sorry, I assumed that the the various new machines with the internal
CD-ROM bay worked the same as the Quadra 900.  Obviously they don't.
I can use any of three inputs by changing the radio button under
the sound cp on my Quadra 900, Microphone, External, and CD-ROM.  I
always leave the microphone plugged in (even though I never use
it).

Sorry, this must be a FAQ, but it's a quick fix that I need to take care of  
before a demo in less than 24 hours from now! Couldn't think of a better place  
for a rapid answer than comp.sys.mac.hardware.

I need to connect the Serial A of a Compac 386/20 PC to the printer port of a  
Mac IIci. Does anyone have handy the pin-pin routing for the cable that would  
allow this connection? 

The serial port on the Compaq is a MALE DB9. How would this map to the DIN8 of  
the Mac serial? I tried one of those really short femaleDB9-maleDIN8 cables  
that Apple sold as adaptors to plug in Macintosh serial peripherals from the  
pre-MacPlus era. This cable didn't do it. Do I need a null modem adaptor as  
well on the DB9 side of things? 

I just need to be able to map the data TX and RX pins correctly.


thanks kindly,

I don't know how to say it best but you are gaurenteed that the
price of the C650 is going to drop this year.  This week's MacWeek
reports that Apple is probably planning a drop in August.  My guess
is that it may come sooner if Apple decides to  change the price
structure upon release of the multimedia units this summer.

Your price looks pretty good at about $50 more then I payed for
mine last month.  I would have rather waited for one of the new
machines this sommer (like the Cyclone) but the resale value of my
IIci would have not been squat by then.  Thus, financing forced me
to purchase now.  I'm happy with the machine and won't feel
betrayed at all when Apple cuts the price to less then $1000 next
week (heh).

Bottome line:  If the C650 does what you want, buy it.  If you wait
until the Cylcones come out for a price break then you might as
well wait for the PowerPCs to come out for another price break and
then the units which follow them.  You may save some money but
you've lost a lot of time when you could have been using the
computer.  Face it, Apple's prices are going to be in a continuous
state of flux.  At least they aren't going to try raising them
again (grin).

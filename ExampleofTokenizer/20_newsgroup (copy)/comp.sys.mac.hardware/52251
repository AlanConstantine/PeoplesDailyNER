  OOPS - got home and re-checked and found out that it
ISNT the Radius Video Vision which was mentioned as having
problems.  None the less, I still have a chance to buy one

and if there has been a newer model introduced (accounting
for the price reduction?)

THANKS and thousands of apologies to Radius ...

You're not going to like this, but if memory serves me, postings
I've read in this newsgroup and elsewhere indicate that there are
no, repeat no, internal modems for the Duo besides the Express
Modem... at _any_ speed.  Something having to do with the modem
using the main CPU for some of its tasks, and Apple not releasing
details on the architecture, or something.  I'm vague on the
details, but the gist was that there are going to be no
third-party internal Duo modems.  If I'm wrong, somebody please
correct me on this.  Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.

I'm currently trying to select which magneto-optical drive to purchase.  I'm
primarily looking at 128MB drives, although I might consider 256MB ones.

When looking through MacWorld and MacUser ads, the prices for the 128MB drives
seem to range from just under $1000 (for the DGR 128REM Portable, Magic 128MB
Portable Fujitsu, or NuDesign 128MB from MacDirect) to about $1600 (for the
FWB HammerDisk 130 and Mass Microsystems DataPak MO/128).  Different drives
use different mechanisms - MOST, Fujitsu, Sony, Epson, probably some others.

My problem is that after reading the Nov 92 MacWorld and Apr 93 MacUser
reviews of these drives, I'm still not sure what to get.  So, I'm asking
if anyone has had good/bad experiences with any 128MB M-O drive or can shed
some light on the wide range of prices (is spending more really buying me
much?), reliability of different drives, compatibility between them, or 
anything else I should probably know.

Thanks.

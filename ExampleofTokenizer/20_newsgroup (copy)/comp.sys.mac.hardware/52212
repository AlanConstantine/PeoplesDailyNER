A similar reason is why people at work, used to seeing SCO unix running
on a 486, are suprised when they see my Sun-3 at home running faster w/a 16MHz
68020/68881.  The Sun was designed from the ground up for UNIX, the PC
wasn't.

This is why you need a gargantuan processor to run Windows.  The basic
design of the box is all wrong. (Would've been better if MS had put most
of Windows on a plug-in ROM card from day one. (priced at $24.95 or
so...) People woulda loved it.

Apple had the right idea, just stumbled a bit in the execution.

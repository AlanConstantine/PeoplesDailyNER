Sorry about the misinformation.  I made a bad assumption about
the new machines behaving like a Quadra 900, see previous
post.  About sampling the CD audio though, have you tried it?  I 
found the aliasing to be really bad.  Like it needed a filter or something.
Much worse than I expected.  I installed the CD-300 in the 
Quadra myself so maybe I missed something.  Everything else
works great though.

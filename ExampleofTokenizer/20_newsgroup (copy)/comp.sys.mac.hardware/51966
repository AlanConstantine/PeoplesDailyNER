FWB distributes HDT Personal Edition (HDT = Hard Drive Toolkit), which
is what I own. This is less fancy than the "full" version, but good
enough for what you and I want to do. Casa Blanca offers Drive7, but
I'm not that familiar with it. I *think* that both Drive7 and HDT PE
can be had for around US$50.

I've used Silverlinging at work (v 5.42??), and I like HDT PE much
better. IMHO it has a better interface, and easier to understand.

Any Drive7 users?

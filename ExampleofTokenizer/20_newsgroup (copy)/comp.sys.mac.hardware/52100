I had mention in a previous article that I was searching for the 300 external
drive.  I did call Apple Catalog as recommended and they told me the drives
were back ordered until May 8.  I placed an order anyways and two days later
I had a visit from Federal Express.  Well, you can guess how I spent my weekend.
Of course I ended up paying list price but you do get a free copy of PC Exchange
when you order from the Apple Catalog.  You may want to check if they have any
internal drives.

BTW, an older version of GateKeeper (I don't recall which version), hung up my
Mac when trying to access a photoCD or audio disk.  I got the newer version
which did mention a conflict with the Apple 4.xx CD driver.

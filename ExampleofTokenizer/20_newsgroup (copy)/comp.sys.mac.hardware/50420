Hi. I am looking into buying a Floptical Drive, and was wondering what  
experience people have with the drives from Iomega, PLI, MASS MicroSystems,  
or Procom. These seem to be the main drives on the market. Any advice?

Also, I heard about some article in MacWorld (Sep '92, I think) about  
Flopticals. Could someone post a summary, if they have it?

Thanks in advance. (Reply by post or email, whichever you prefer.)

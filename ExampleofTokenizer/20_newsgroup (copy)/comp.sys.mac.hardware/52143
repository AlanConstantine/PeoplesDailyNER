What is the real story here? Can I hook up any PC SVGA Montitor to the
Centris internal video? Do I need to make my own cable if it doesn't not
come with one? Has apple released a Tech note with the pinouts for doing
such? The reasoj I ask is that it seems the prices for SVGA are lower than
that of their mac counterparts...

    having been discusse essentially adnausium the answer is yes.  at
least for the 600x400 configuration.  you can get an adaptor called Mac
VGA -Q from James engineering (510) 525 7350 and this will let you
display 600x400 and 800x600 if the monitor is capable.  I think the
800x600 requires 56Khz horizontal sync.  I use this on my sony 1604. 
(gives a slightly wider screen than the 832x624 adaptor.

hope it helps
                                                                    -A.

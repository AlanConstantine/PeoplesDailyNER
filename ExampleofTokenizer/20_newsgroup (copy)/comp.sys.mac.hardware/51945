Last week's MacWEEK article by Ric Ford indicated that David Ramsey's
Mac IIx has been running nicely with a Mac IIci ROM in it, offering
clean 32-bit ROM code (liberating his IIx from the virtual memory
nightmare caused by Apple's 32-bit System Enabler).

Does anyone know of a source for these ROMs?  Is it okay for a
remanufacturer to resell only ROM chips from used machines?  I know that
copies cannot be made, but it seems to me that it would be okay to
resell the original used ROM.  (After all, reselling a used computer
involves the sale of the ROM anyway, so what's the difference?).

Needless to say, I'm interested in purchasing such a ROM.  What would
be a reasonably price to offer?

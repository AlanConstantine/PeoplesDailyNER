Hello,
  I just got some SIMMs,  at least one of which does not work. I don't know if 
there is a software that can test SIMMs thoroughly or I could just rely on the 
RAM test performed by my computer during the start up. When I installed a dead 
SIMM into an LC or  an LC II, there would be a strange music and no display on 
the screen. Why? I need your help! Thanks in advance

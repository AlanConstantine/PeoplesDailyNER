Hi... what alternatives to the Express modem do Duo owners have (if
they want to go at least 9600 baud)?

Every place in town says they are back ordered, and part of the reason
I want a laptop mac is so I can use it as a remote terminal from
wherever I am, but I really would hate to have to wait 2 months to get
a modem in or have to settle with 2400 baud.

Thank you,

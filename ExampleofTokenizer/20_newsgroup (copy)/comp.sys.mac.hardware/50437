   * the Sony CPD-1304 has better video circuitry than either of the
   other two monitors.  It can display Apple 640x480, VGA 640x480, VGA
   800x600 (though this has 56 Hz flicker), and Apple 832x624 (75 Hz
   refresh:  no flicker at all).  It might be able to display Apple's
   1024x768, but I'm not sure about this, and the pixels would be real
   small anyway so it might not be that useful.

   Note that with either Sony monitor, you will need the proper adapter,
   which both connects the video signals properly, but also informs the
   Macintosh video hardware of which display mode to use.

I'm assuming that the cabling tells the Mac, at startup, what kind of
monitor is connected.  Now I think I've seen ads in popular Mac
magazines for products (I'm not sure if it's just a monitor, just a
video card, or a package of both) that allow you to change resolutions
on the fly (w/o restarting the Mac).

If you were to buy a 1304, would it be possible to switch back and
forth between Apple 640x480 and Apple 832x624 without restarting the
Mac?  Is this strictly a hardware startup function, or can software
intervene, or does the Mac hardware occasionally probe the cable
setting and switch automatically?

Thanks,

Eric

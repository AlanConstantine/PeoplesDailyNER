I have done several of these upgrades (about 6 IIsi's, and 1 Quadra 700), and
the best thing to use would be some sort of "heat sink compound". If possible,
you should look for the silicon-free stuff. There's a comany who makes the stuff
called Tech Spray, their address is: P.O. Box 949, Amarillo, TX 79105.

You should be wary in using most kinds of tape; and definately don't use duct
tape  that stuff is for ducts...

When using the heat sink glue or compound, only use enough to fill the small
space between the heat sink and the CPU.

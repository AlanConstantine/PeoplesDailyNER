I'm currently having trouble connecting my PB to a true blue (IBM Model
1513) VGA monitor.  The display is bearly readable but all the details are
seperated into yellow and red colors. ie. a window will have two images one
in yellow and a ghost image in red.  The background is also a little
greenish.  I read some time ago, before I ever thought I would hook my mac
up to a VGA screen, about an incompatability with some VGA monitors due to
the sync on green signal.  Does this sound like it could be the same demon?
 I also read that there are both hardware (putting a diode on the green
signal?) solution and a software solution to this problem.  I don't the
details does somebody have them the can e-mail to me or post them?  I
checked all the FAQ's for this and didn't find anything about it.  Did I
miss it somewhere?  This sure seems that it would be a good thing to have
in one.  Thanks for any replys.

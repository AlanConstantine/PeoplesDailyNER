Mac sound hardware is diverse; some macs play in stereo and
mix the output (the SE/30 for instance) while others play in
stereo but ONLY has the left channel for the speaker, while
some are "truly" mono (like the LC)

Developers know that stuff played in the left channel is
guaranteed to be heard, while the right channel isn't. Some
send data to both, some only send data to the left channel
(the first is preferrable, of course)

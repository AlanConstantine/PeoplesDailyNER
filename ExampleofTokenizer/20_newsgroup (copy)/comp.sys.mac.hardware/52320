Andrew,
        I had the same problem when I bought some additional VRAM. In my case
the problem arose when I set the color depth to 16 bit on a 14" monitor.  The
problem was solved by sending back the SIMMs and getting different ones. 
Someone on a local bbs I use said that the problem is with incompatible VRAM
chips and that Apple has some kind of repair/technical note discussing the
issue.

        If you've had the problem since day 1, I'd take the chips back to
whomever sold them to you and get good ones.

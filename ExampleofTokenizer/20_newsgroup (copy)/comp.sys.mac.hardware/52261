I recently bought a PLI 21mgbyte floptical drive, and I was very happy 
with it until I tried to use it to format a 1.4 HD diskette. I put the
HD floppy in my Superdrive to check that the floptical had formatted it
correctly, and now my Superdrive refuses to recognize ANY floppy (it says
"this disk is unreadable" and asks if I want to format it) even original
systems floppies from Apple. Nor will it format the disks if I try to
("initialization failed!")  Strangely enough the floptical still reads
both the 21 MB and 1.4 HD disks, but I cant look at my 800k floppies, and
if I have a crash I'm screwed because the Floptical can't be used as a
start-up disk.  PLI has been unresponsive.  Any ideas? Has this happened
to anyone before? I was looking for an inexpensive storage solution, and
now I am looking at an expensive repair.  Help! respond to this thread, or
email mfeldman@acs.bu.edu

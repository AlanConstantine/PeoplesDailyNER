If you use System 7, you can use my application Zing which has
a 30 kB footprint (meaning you can have it running all the time
without losing memory)

It is also compatible with the chat program "FishBomb" which allows
sounds and pictures as well.

Both are, as far as I know, freeware (I dustribute Zing with source)
and should be available on the normal services (mac.archive.umich.edu
for instance)

Cheers,

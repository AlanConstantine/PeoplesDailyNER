I think you are suffering from some alignment or color
table or <whatever> problems, if a Color Classic is as fast
as a Quadra rendering to screen.

What screen card you use does of course matter much (built-in
video is almost always faster than NuBus)

Or you measured "scroll entire screen" where the Color Classic
had a VRAM 10" screen in 4-bit color and the Quadra had a
21" 24-bit screen on NuBus :-)

Cheers,

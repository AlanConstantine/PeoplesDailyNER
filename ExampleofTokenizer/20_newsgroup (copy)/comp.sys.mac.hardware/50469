The IIvx...LCIII performance at a Centris 610 price. The only reason
to get an IIvx is if you really need the full-size Nubus slots. Keep 
in mind that the 610 supports all Apple monitors and has optional Ethernet.
This lessens (but doesn't eliminate) the need for Nubus cards. And unless
you're running FPU-intensive software, the 610 will blow the doors off the
LCIII and the IIvx. The LCIII, on the other hand, is sufficient for most
people and has a great price.

If you haven't guessed, I find halving the bus clock (the IIvx 32MHz uP vs.
16MHz bus) a throughly bad thing and I hope Apple never does it again.

I am boring my sister HP DeskJet 500C for the weekend and I was wondering
in their was any drivers for it available some where that would allow
me to use it with my Mac SE/30.  I have a copy of MacPrint but I do think
that I have a driver for the 500C.  I would be happy to get it working
in black & white, but if there is away to get the color working that would
be better.  Any ideas someone?

Regards,

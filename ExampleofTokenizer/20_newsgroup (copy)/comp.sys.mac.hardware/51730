I know that Jet Inc makes refills for the Stylewriter and Deskwriter
ink jet cartridges in several colors....but are pre-filled cartridges
in color available from anyone (or do I have to use-up one cartridge 
before I have a chance to print in color?)

Also, are inks in process colors (cyan, magenta, yellow) available
to refill cartridges?

Thanks in advance....

I have a MacIIFX and I know that it is wired about its SCSI chain.

I just bought a drive and I need to find out a few hardcore SCSI question:

Does the IIFX SCSI chain want to see active or passive termination?

Does the IIFX SCSI spec want me to enable the initiation of the SDTR message?

WHat does the IIFX SCSI spec want as far as parity checking?

These are some very good questions for the FAQ.       
If someone does not have time to answer these questions but does know 
where I can look them up please let me know and I will repost the answers
for everyone to see.

thanks,

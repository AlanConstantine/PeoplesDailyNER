I'm having exactly the same problem.  Again, it's fine when I switch to 16
colors or a smaller monitor.  My configuration is:
 
Model: Centris 610 with 4 MB/80 HD, 512 VRAM, no cards
Monitor: MAG MX15F with 16" monitor adaptor (for resolution of 832*624)
 
I just discovered the problem a little while ago after plugging in my
new MAG monitor.  It seems to appear either when scrolling through a
window or when using Alpha or Word and I enter <return>.
 
My guess is bad VRAMs as well.  I really hope it isn't a design flaw.  Is
anyone at Apple listening?

***********************************

    Try finding an init called Basic color monitor.  This should clear
up some probs with Centris 610's and vga type monitors.  I know it
exists, somewhere I have a binhexed copy, but I don't know where and
never got around to installing it.  I have this problem on my sony 1604.

                                                                    -A.

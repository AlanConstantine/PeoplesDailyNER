I've got the official word on the LaserWriter Pro 600 memory
upgrade.

I just got off of the phone with the quite friendly Donna Rossi
at Apple Customer Assistance.  She tells me that those who
purchased the LaserWriter Pro 600 in a 4 megabyte (300dpi, no
greyscale) configuration should contact their original dealers
who are supposed provide the 4-meg memory upgrade.  For those
who don't know, the extra 4-meg will allow printing at 600dpi 
or greyscale (at 300dpi).

If the dealers have questions, they should be directed to their
hardware support numbers and/or Apple Customer Assistance 
1-800-776-2333, 408-996-1010 (corporate number).

Regards,

Glenn

P.S. - personally, I'm annoyed at our school bookstore.  They
really have an obligation to provide this information to all
of the customers who purchased the 600 in the original 
configuration (they have the records...that's why they ask for
things like a phone number).  When I get my upgrade completed, 
I'm going to write Apple and complain.

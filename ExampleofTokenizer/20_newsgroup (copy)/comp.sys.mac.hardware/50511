Please, I beg you. If you know anything about the Caere Typist Plus
Graphics Hand Scanner, Please read and solve my problem. I will be
truely grateful for the rest of my life!

The problem is that My Caere Typist Plus Graphics Hand Scanner will not
connect to my PowerBook 160. The Cable on the Scanner will not fit into
the SCSI port on the PowerBook.

I then got a cable assembled to adapt the original cable to fit the SCSI
port. This, however, turned the computer into SCSI mode and treated it
as a hard disk.

I have asked an engineer in London to assembled a new cable. The idiot,
out of sheer laziness has taken 14 weeks and has yet to solve the
problem. 

I am aware that Caere Co. in the US have a solution.

Do you know of a cable that will solve this problem. Please help me if
you know the solution. I will be forever grateful to you.

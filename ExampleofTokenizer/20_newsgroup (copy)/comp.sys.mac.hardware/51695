I am continuing to collect user results to produce a more comprehensive
report on IIsi clock oscillator upgrades. I you have attempted the modification
please drop me a note with details of your experience. The more reports 
obtained, the more accurate the numbers I will generate.

If possible, please include the following:
  1) Top speed achieved
  2) System configuration at top Mhz setting
       a) speed rating of the CPU (the last two digits printed on CPU #)
       b) presence of additional heat sinks
       c) Nubus & FPU cards used
       d) floppy drive functionality on both 800 and 1.4 M disks
  3) Damage incurred during modification
  4) Damage due to higher speed use
  5) Average length of time the CPU is on. (i.e. 8 hours a day)
  6) Unusual other modifications to the usual procedure

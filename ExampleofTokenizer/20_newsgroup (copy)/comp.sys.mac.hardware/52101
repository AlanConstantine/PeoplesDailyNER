Looking for a Mac PB 100 that's in good condition (brand new, w/warranty
would be ideal).  It should also include the external floppy drive and have
at least a 40 MEG internal hard drive with 4 MEG of RAM.

So... if you have a PB100 that you'd like to turn into cash, please write me.

Thanks, very much.

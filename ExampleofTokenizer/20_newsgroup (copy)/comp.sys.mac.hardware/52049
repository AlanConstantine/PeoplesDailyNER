OK, if I post where this comes from, will people stop sending email 
asking where I negotiated the deal? ;-)

The deal is from "International Computer and Networking" in CA.
(I saw the ad int he back of MacWorld and MacUser)...
phone number is 310-441-9181 and the deal may have changed since
a few weeks ago, since they change prices about every ten minutes ;-)

Alas, this is a funny system, it SOUNDS like a good deal, but this is a 
Centris 650, 4MB (on the motherboard) 4MB SIMM, 80MB HD, NO ETHERNET
and NO COPROCESSOR (well, actually it's a 68LC040 instead of a 68RC040,
'just had to say that to keep people from saying "there is no such thing
as an '040 without a coprocessor, since the FPU is built into the chip")

OK, there ya have it, but if I were you, I would wait untill the cyclones
come out and buy a Quadra 800 ;-)

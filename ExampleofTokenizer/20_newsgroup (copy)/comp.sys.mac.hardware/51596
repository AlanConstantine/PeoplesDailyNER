Lines: 5

I am in the market for a 120M hard drive! I have a IIsi with 5/80 and I am
almost all filled up! Is anyone selling any HD's for the Mac for cheap? Where
can I get one through mail order and where is the best place to buy from for
the best prices? Is there anyone on the net or on this newsgroup that sells
them for wholesale or cheaper? Any info would be appreciated! Thanks!

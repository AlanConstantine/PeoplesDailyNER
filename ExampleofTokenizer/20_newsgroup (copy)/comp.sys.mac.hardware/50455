When Apple came with their demos to Iowa State, I got a chance to run
Speedometer3.1 on some of the new Macs.  Both machines were running
System7.1, had a 14" RGB.  Don't know what the caches were set to.
Neither machine had an FPU  It appears that the Centris610 is quite a
bit faster than the LC III:

		Centris610		LCIII

CPU		13.01			6.92
Graf		15.67			7.69
Disk		2.22			2.44
Math		25.57			10.19

P.R. Rating	12.91			6.58

So, there is a comparison.  There is definitely a very noticable speed
difference between these two machines according to Speedometer3.1.

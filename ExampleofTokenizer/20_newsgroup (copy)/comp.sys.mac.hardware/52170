    Mostly. The Q950 does have a SCSI2 controller chip as it's SCSI
chip, but it does not have the chips to use the Wide or Fast SCSI-2
modes and therefore doesn't offer much more in the way of SCSI
performance over the Q900. It does, howrever, have a faster I/O
controller than the Q900; this is where the real speed boost comes from.

A fair number of brave souls who upgraded their SI clock oscillator have
shared their experiences for this poll. Please send a brief message detailing
your experiences with the procedure. Top speed attained, CPU rated speed,
add on cards and adapters, heat sinks, hour of usage per day, floppy disk
functionality with 800 and 1.4 m floppies are especially requested.

I will be summarizing in the next two days, so please add to the network
knowledge base if you have done the clock upgrade and haven't answered this
poll. Thanks.

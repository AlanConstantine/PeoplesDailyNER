Hi all,  

I have a IIsi with a floppy drive that might be bad (and might just be out
of alignment, I haven't checked yet. :-))  If the drive is not easily
reparable, I'd like to replace it with an _internal_ floptical.  Can this
be easily done?  Can it be done at all?  

I'm assuming that floptical drives can read and write both 800k and 1.4k
floppies.  If this is not in fact true, please tell me.

Thanks in advance,
        ~ Kiran

A few posts back, somebody mentioned that the Duo might crash if it has
the wrong kind (non-self refreshing) of RAM in it.  My Duo crashes
sometimes after sleep, and I am wondering if there is any software which
will tell me whether or not I have the right kind of RAM installed.  I
had thought that the problem was the battery connection.

Thanks in Advance,

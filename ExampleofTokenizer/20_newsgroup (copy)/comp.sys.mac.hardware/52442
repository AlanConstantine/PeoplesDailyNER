A friend is heavily into MIDI and is using a Quadra 900 (maybe 950) with 
all but one NuBus slot populated with arcane music hardware and a video
card.  He reports 8 bit video is too slow for good real-time display of
what he needs to see.  He also reports that the built-in video is even
worse.  He's not a Mac guru, and I haven't seen the system, so this is
about all I know.

I suspect that his NuBus is heavily loaded, and think improvements might
come from a switch to an accelerated PDS slot video card.  Does this
sound right?  Who makes a PDS accelerated video card for the Quadra thats
worth looking at?  Any other suggestions?  Thanks in advance!

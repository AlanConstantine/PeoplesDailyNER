Does anyone have a version of "Which Mac Do I Buy?"
that is later than v 1.3.1?

I no longer have access the ZiffNet/Mac, accessed
through CompuServe, to check for myself.

"Which Mac..." is a HyperCard stack that assists
in decision making based on budget, features, and
main software used.

Please let me know if you can help me out. Download
from CompuServe should not cost much if a higher speed
modem is used. Stack, compressed, is about 125KB?

Thanks for any help...

Have you tried the library?
Since you go to WPI (so do I), go to AK and look on the first floor, a 
professor has posted an IEEE (i believe) spec sheet on the 68060 which
is around 10 pages long.  I'm sure the library has the info you request, It's
just a matter of finding it.


Hope this helps,
Bret Chase

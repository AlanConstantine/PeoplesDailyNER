This is completely false.

This is also false. What you need for multisession capability is
multisession capability -- which is based on the firmware and
electronics, not the drive speed. I'll admit, though, that I have
not seen a multisession capable drive that isn't double speed.

The above (1 & 2), proves 3 to be false.

The Apple CD300 is an excellent double-speed multi-session PhotoCD
capable drive. So are drives based on the slightly-faster Toshiba
XM3401. Some companies selling such drives are: Spin Peripherals (a
bargain at $499) and PLI (a company I hate) and Relax Technologies
(a company I know little about other than that they are  a longtime
player in Mac mailorder, which is usually a good sign). The NEC
CDR74 is also a good choice (NEC's own mechanism, I think). ClubMac
sells it for around $619.

Your welcome, ooh but now I see your from Germany. Most of the
mailorder info does you little good, I guess. If not:
Spin Peripherals -- 800-466-1200
Club Mac         -- 800-258-2622
Relax Tech       -- 510-471-6112

Nothing wrong with the Apple, though, which is based on a Sony
mechanism and speed-identical to the NEC. The Toshiba's speed
advantage is very slight: 20% in average access time (a minor plus)
and 10% in data transfer rate (a slightly more important plus).

Good luck,
Mark

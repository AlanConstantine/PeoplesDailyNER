        I am currently managing, among many other labs, a lab with three 
LC IIs, a Mac Plus with 45 MB external HD, and a LaserWriter II NTX. My 
problem? The LC IIs seem to intermittently slow to a snail's pace.
        These LC IIs have 4 MB RAM, 256K VRAM, and a Quantum LP105S HD 
installed. I have reformatted the drive with Hard Disk Toolkit 1.3, and 
it gives a very respectable 2.9 overall rating to this drive, so it's not 
the drive. I have reinstalled System 7.1, MS-Word 5.1a, MS-Works 3.0, and 
so on, all from the master disks. In short, I have done everything I can 
think of in software. I am *not* a hardware hacker, though I pop cases 
fairly often. But nothing works.
        The problem is intermittent and unpredictable. The mouse always 
moves smoothly, floppies always run at the same speed, but occasionally, 
for about 1-2 hours at a time, a machine will run like it was running on 
a 4 MHz 68000, not a 16 MHz 68030. It is VERY frustrating and makes it 
nearly unusable. It does seem to worsen with increasing disk activity.
        Has anyone encountered this problem before? Has anyone got any 
ideas? They would be much appreciated.

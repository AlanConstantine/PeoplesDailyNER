I have tried almost everything under the sun to get a null modem connection
between a Mac Duo 210 and a PC. I have used MacKermit and VersaTerm on
the Mac side. I have used Procomm, Kermit, and Softerm (on OS/2) on
the PC (or PS) side. I have used non-Hardware handshaking and hardware
ahdshaking cables. And know MY hands are shaking from the effort. Nothing
has allowed file transfers from the Mac to the PS.

In general, I can type back and forth with no trouble, but only if both sides
are set to speeds OVER 9600 baud. I cannot send files from the Mac to the
PS at all, and file transfers from the Duo to the PS are not possible.
When I do a straight ascii send, I can send from the PS to the Duo flawlessly.
I can send Binhex files this way quite fast, and I know that the
transmission is error free.
But straight ascii sent from the Mac to the PS is full of errors.
Unless, of course, I do text pacing so slow that it is like human
typing. (well, like 2-3 times faster than human typing).

I would like to hear from ANYONE who has been able to transfer files
from a Duo 210 to a PS via modem or null modem. If you can do it, please
tell me your EXACT combination of hardware and software. Obviously, I am
talking of a true serial port modem, not the express modem. Maybe some
kind soul with access to a modem and a Duo 210 can check this out for me.

Right now, I am of the opinion that it won't work at high speeds because
of the power interrupts on the Duo, and it won't work at low speeds
because of some crazy reason I don't understand.

Could I hear from someone attesting that they can really pump information
out the serial port of a Duo 210 fast? Like via a modem or via a
sys-ex dump?

Could anyone with a Duo help me out?? I am going absolutely INSANE.
I wanna know if the problem is MY Duo, or all Duo 210s, or all Duos,
or just me.

Yes, I have checked the cable 1,000,000 times. And not only can I type
back and forth, but Zterm alerts the users if s/he uses hardware handshaking
and CTS is down. So I know that hardware handshaking is working. And also,
According to Zterm port stats, the buffer never overflows.

Please help me figure out what's going on...

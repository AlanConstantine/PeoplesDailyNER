	I have an Ethernet card that i took out off an old LC. The card
	is manufactured by Asante. On it i can read:
	"Asante Tech, inc. Copyright 1991. MACCON + LC REV.B".
	The card has an fpu socket on it. It provides thin Ethernet connector
	and there's another connector on it which resembels to phone connectors.

	My questions are:
	- Will this card work on any other model than LC-serie ?, given that
	it's a PDS card, will it work with the IIsi PDS slot ?. I think there
	may be a probleme because the LC has 16 bit wide slots.

	- What's that other conncetor on the card ?.

	_ Is anyone interested in it ?. I can ship it to any CEE country.

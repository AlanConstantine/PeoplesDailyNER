Can anyone tell me what the difference is between a 256K DRAM chip and a
256K SIMM? I need the former (I think) to add memory to my Laserwriter
LS. Someone is offering to sell me 256K SIMMS he removed from an SE, but
I have a feeling this may not be the correct form of memory. The sockets
in the Laserwriter look like they want the spidery-shaped chips (there
are 4 sockets, each with, as I recall, 20 pins, arranged in two rows of 10). Believe it or not, I've never actually seen a SIMM. Help appreciated.

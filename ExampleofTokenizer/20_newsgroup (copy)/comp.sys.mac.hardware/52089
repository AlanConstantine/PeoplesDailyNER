Hello Net.People,

We have a LaserWriter Select 310 (standard 1.5Mb RAM) connected to an LC
III (4/80).

The print driver cannot find any Adobe Type 1 fonts or any TrueType fonts
in the System.

The connections to the printer and the Driver installation are correct
but this 310 printer still refuses to find fonts and work correctly out
of the box.

IMHO, an Apple product not working out of the box is a shameful event.

The installer disks for the printer install: LW Select 310 driver v 1.0,
PrintMonitor v 7.1 and backgrounder v 3.1 (!) on a System 7.1 LC III.

Has anyone else had similar experiences with this printer/configuration,
because we really need some help on this one.

Thanks,
Anthony    anthony@medicine.adelaide.edu.au

My friend has a Macintosh IIfx on which he is running System 6.0.7 (not enough
memory yet to run Sys7 adequately), and he noticed that when he tries to use
Multifinder on this machine, the machine will beep every few seconds
incessantly, nonstop.

Now, this friend has a tendency to "install" things on his machine rather
haphazardly, but he *did* rebuild his System from scratch and it still occurs. 
Does this problem sound familiar at all to anyone?  For all I know the problem
is caused by something really obscure but if this is a known simple thing
(yeah, right...) that someone is familiar with (like "System 6.0.7 Multifinder
doesn't run on a Mac IIfx"), or if someone here knows what he should be looking
for, please send e-mail either to me or to him (smh@vaxf.acdnj.itt.com).
Thanx in advance.

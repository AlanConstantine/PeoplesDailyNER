I thnik i'll be able to pick up  a piar of Mac 512K's for nothing, but
their power supplies are dead.  Anyone know where I can pick up a pair
of refurbished PS's for cheap (preferably mail order).
Yes, I do have uses planned fior them.  One will be sold to a friend who
just needs a terminal to connect via modem to his e-mail account.
The other will be used by me as a net client to run my downloads and/or
printing.
  
Also, what is the latest system software usable with these suckers?

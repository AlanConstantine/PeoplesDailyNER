Subject: Re: DeskWriter Drivers 3.1 -- How to install ?
Lines: 16

Can someone tell me which of the files that come with DW-3.1 go where
and for what purpose?  What can be left out, for instance, if
you don't want to do background printing?

As far as I can remember, all you need to do to get your Deskwriter up and
printing using the 3.1 driver is to drag the driver itself (either serial or
appletalk depending on your needs) to the system folder. You don't need the
fonts or anything else if all you want is straight forward, bare bones, basic
printing....I don't have anything else installed and can still print on a
Deskwriter using sys7.1 and HP driver 3.1

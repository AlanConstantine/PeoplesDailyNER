For sale, or trade some combination for 286-16 motherboard or 2400 v.42bis

Monochrome monitor, pretty generic, for IBM.

8088 motherboard, 7 Mhz, built in monochrome and color support, built in
serial and parallel ports.  Stick it in a robot, use it to make a cheap
terminal, whatever.

5.25" internal Low density disk drive.

1200 baud external modem, practical peripherals.

Make me an offer.  oR suggest a trade for whatever you have.

Fellow netters,

I just wanted to let you know that there are a few honest and good people out
there (even outside of Iowa).  I'm sorry if anyone thinks that I am wasting
space, but I thought you might want some relief from the "So-and-so is a thief"
posts.  Not that I think we shouldn't hear about the bad deals, but it would be
nice to hear some good news once in a while.

After seeing his post on one of the for sale groups, I mailed Mr. Mark Miller a
request for his copy of WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS.  He suggested a price of $50
in his ad, but when I phoned him, he quoted $40 plus shipping.  That sounded
more than fair to me, so I told him that I would send him a check the next day. 
Imagine my surprise when I logged into my account the following day and found a
message from him saying that it had already been sold (after I had just mailed
the money order).  After another E-Mail message to him, he apologized and
assured me that it was a mistake - I was the one who he was holding it for.  He
sent the package as soon as he got the money, along with a letter stating a
transfer of license.  This wasn't good enough for WordPerfect, so I asked him
to fill out one of their forms.  No problem - we thought.  It took three times
to get it to the right address (my fault).  Anyway, he mailed me the form for
my signature and included a Workbook that I had no idea was included in the
deal.  Again, he apologized for not sending it before.  I now have the world's
best word processor and a renewed hope in the world that there are a few good
ones left.  I recoend that if you ever see that Mark is selling anything thatat
you may want, give him a call.  If I had the choice, I would purchase all of my
software from him.

Bravo, Mr. Miller!

DEC LK250-AA PC keyboard for sale:

   - same exact key layout as DEC's VT2xx, VT3xx, etc., with DEC 
        names on keys as well as PC names

   - great for use with a VTxxx terminal emulator - all the keys are there
        and in the correct place. (i.e. GOLD PF1, PF2, etc.)

   - perfect condition, very good feel

   - $130 + shipping  (DEC price was around $300)

Send email if you have questions.

I have this kit which includes the following :

1)	82c84a/82c84a-5
	CHMOS CLOCK GENERATOR AND DRIVER
	FOR 8086,80C88 PROCESSORS
2)	27C64/87C64
	64K(8Kx8) CHMOS UV ERASABLE PROM
3)	51C259L
	LOW POWER 64K x 4
	CHMOS DYNAMIC RAM
4)	82C59A-2
	CHMOS PROGRAMMABLE INTERRUPT CONTROLLER
5)	82C88
	CHMOS BUS CONTROLLER
	FRO 80C86,80C88 PROCESSORS
6)	80C88/80C88-2
	8-BIT CHMOS MICROPROCESSOR
7)	82C55A
	CHMOS PROGRAMMABLE PERIPHERAL INTERFACE
8)	82C54
	CHMOS PROGRAMMABLE INTERVAL TIMER
9)	82C08
	CHMOS DYNAMIC RAM CONTROLLER

All these are chips with complete manual in a box. I don't know whether they
still work or not, and I don't really know what they are. 

So this is mainly for those who knows what this is and have use of it 
(probably EE stuff since this used to belong to a EE student)

Anyone interested, please make me an offer.

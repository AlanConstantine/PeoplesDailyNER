	 Hello, this package is the right thing for you if you are 
planning a short vacation in central Florida. For $169, you get:

	--Four nights in first class hotels for two adults and up
to three children. Two nights each in Orlendo and Daytona Beach.
You will pay additional state tax of $3/day (required by law).

	--A great coupon book for major tourist atractions, 
restaurants, etc.

	--Fully transferable. It expires at 9/16/93. Can be extended
for a whole year for only $20 more.

	--you need to make reservation 45 days in advance otherwise
the availability of hotel is not ganranteed.

	--Price negotiable.

	The reason I am selling it is because I missed the deadline
of using it for last Chrismas.  

	If interested, email ll12@midway.uchicago.edu

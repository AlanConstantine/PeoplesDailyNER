Greetings!

            I have 2 sets of plugs for your oscilloscope or function
      hooks.  
             I also have 2 sets of probes.  They have multipliers
      of x1 and x10.  There is also an REF switch.  

             All these probes and plugs are in excellent conditions.

             If interested, please make me an offer.  I will respond
      to your replies by Wed.

                                                    Al

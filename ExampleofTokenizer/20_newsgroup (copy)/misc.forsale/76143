Hi to all.

Since all of you could also be a seller as well as a buyer, I'd like to bring
this issue for discussion - what would be the best solution in case a deal 
became a lemon?

As I understand most people selling things over the net do not grant a warranty,I am in such a situation that the seller did not state whether a warranty would be granted or not and the item I received is out of order. The seller insisted
that it was 'in good condition' when he sent it and so would just return half ofthe amount that I paid if I send the item back to him and after he is sured it
is bad. Is this reasonable?

Basically I would like to believe the seller tells the truth. Also, I am positively to say that I've not done anything wrong which might cause the failure of 
the thing. My assumption here is everyone is honest - so rule out the possibility that either one of the two parties or both are liars.

I would like to hear your opinion - either in here or directly respond to my
e-mail address.

I know there is such a risk that you could lose money. But, how can we make it
enjoyable to most people and not wasting the bandwidth?

This drive is less than one year old.  The cartridges have all been bought
since then.  All is in excellent condition and still under warranty.
Due to a change in system use, I now need a large, contiguous drive.

Offer includes:
	SyDos 44i internal drive
	SCSI adapter card and cables
	All original documentation
	Software
	All original packaging
	8 cartridges totalling over 350Mb (no bad sectors or defects)

The installation was a breeze on my 386 clone.

I will trade for something near 300Mb IDE, or sell for $450.
I will also consider trading for 4 4Mx9 30 pin SIMMs at 70ns.

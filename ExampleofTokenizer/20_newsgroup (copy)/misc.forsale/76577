	Please take this system off my hands.  I no longer use it and it is
taking up valuable room.  They system consists of a Microcom PDOS Apple II+
clone with 64k on board and PDOS installed.  It comes with a load of boards,
including:  a disk drive board, 2 Z80 boards, a 16k board, an 80 column
board, a couple printer boards including the Grappler II+.  It has 2 1/2 height
drives and a cooling fan attachement.  The keyboard is of the extended 
variety with builting keywords and a keypad.  All of it for $170.

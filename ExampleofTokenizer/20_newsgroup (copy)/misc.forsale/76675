I recently upgraded to a 486 and have found out I don't really have a need
for my old 386.  I'd prefer to sell just the motherboard and keep the case
etc, so I'll offer the motherboard and case separately and let you decide.

I'm asking $325 for the motherboard, which has:
    25Mhz 386 DX (not SX)
    8 megabytes of 32-bit, 70ns memory
    AMI BIOS
    based on C&T NEAT chipset
    	(this means the motherboard and bus circuitry timings are
	programmable - the BIOS' advanced configuration menus let you
	select system, DMA, bus clock, wait states, command delays, etc.)
    "baby AT" sized - fits in mini-tower, full-sized or most any other case
(Includes User's Guide and a copy of the BIOS reference manual)

For $150 more you could have the rest of the system too:
    full-size AT case with 200(?) watt power supply
    2 serial, 1 parallel, 1 game ports
    20Mb hard disk
    1.2Mb floppy disk
    keyboard
    video card (choice of VGA or ???)

If you're interested, please give me a call.  The system is set up at my house
in Aloha, and you're welcome to come test drive it.

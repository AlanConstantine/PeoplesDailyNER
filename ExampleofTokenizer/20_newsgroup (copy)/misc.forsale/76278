FOR SALE!!!!

1) Sony Car Stereo Amplifier (Model XM-2040)
	Rated Power 20Wx4, into 4 Ohms from 20-20,000Hz @0.5%THD
	2 Ohm Stable
        Short Circuit and Overload Protected
 
This is a great little amplifier that I picked up as a demo model at Lechmere
last spring, and never got a chance to install. It's been tested, and it 
works great...a perfect amplifier for adding 4-speaker power to a system, or 
for powering mids or tweets...whatever. Mounted on a board, complete with a 
RS 15 Amp noise filter, with all connections made to barrier strips for easy 
screw-type contacts. Lists new in Crutchfield for $129, am asking 
			$75 O.B.O complete


2) Sony Electronic Crossover (Model XEC-500)
	Freq Response 5-100,000 Hz (+0,-3 dB)
	S/N Ratio 105 dB (A wtd.)
	High Pass X-Over @flat,80,120,180 Hz (12dB/octave)
	Low Pas X-Over @50,80,120,180 Hz (18dB/octave)
	1/2 DIN size for In-Dash Installation in many cars!

This to,l is an exceptional unit which I found extremely useful  back in the 
days when I had a car to put a stereo in. Two sets of RCA-type inputs (F/R), and Three sets of Outputs (F/R/Sub) Each output with seperate level control. 
variable Low Boost control (+10 dB@40 Hz) for extending low bass, and seperate High and Low pass crossover points make this a great unit for anybody who's 
interested in building a Sub/Satellite type system 
	
	Used with orig. box&Papers $130 O.B.O
	 

Both units work flawlessly, and are in excellent shape cosmtically (ie No 
scratches, etc.) Anyone who is interested, please respond to

I'll be happy to answer any questions you might have...oh yeah if you want both
I'll sell the Amp with th X-Over for $175 or so...Thanks

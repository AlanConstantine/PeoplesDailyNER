        I recently backed out of purchasing an almost-unused Sony TCD-D3 DAT
Walkman, having found someone else who has a unit I personally prefer (and am
paying more for).  However, it's still a heck of a machine for the price -- it
is quite rugged, and many people out there swear by it.  (It's probably the
most popular walkman-style DAT machine out there.)

        Anyway, the guy selling it is Bryan Davis (bdavis@netcom.com), and
here's what he told me:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is what is included:
        - TCD-D3 DATman.
        - (2) RCA to Stereo 1/8" plug cables.  One for analog input, one for
          analog output.
        - Optical digital I/O cable (one lead for input, one for output).
        - A copy of my sales receipt with a note about your purchase.  The
          unit is still under factory warrantee.
        - AC adaptor/battery charger.
        - Rechargable battery.

I paid $750 + tax for it so I hope you don't mind if I keep the 60 minute
tape it came with (I have some samples on it!).

[By the way, he spent at least $100 too much for it, unless he's including an
 extended warranty, which is advised for DAT machines, since it costs about
 $300 to replace the head when it wears out, and it probably will within 5
 years if you use it a lot.. -- davisonj]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        I'm not going to quote my sale price for him: that would not be nice.
Send him mail and ask him what he wants.

        Again, I've used the TCD-D3, and I have to say that I can certainly
understand why it is as popular as it is.  I've been using one for a little
while, and although I had some problems with it recently, I should also point
out that the particular one I was using had been on the road for two years and
had truly been _used_ during that time.  (This is the same exact DAT machine
that was lugged around the U.S. and Canada to record the Jazz Butcher
Conspiracy for their recent live album.)

        Bryan Davis says:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I know at least half a dozen professional musicians and record labels
in S.F who use that model (and have been for a while) with no reported
problem.  My problem is that everyone I know already has one.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        'nuff said.

        The reason I'm not getting it is that I found someone else selling me a
unit that features phono-plug SPDIF I/O instead of optical (I don't have any
optical ports on my equipment, but you, the reader, might), and it also has
some other bells & whistles that the TCD-D3 doesn't.  (I am also paying more
for the alternative.)  Note that phono-plug-to-optical SPDIF adapters are
available if you absolutely must have one.

        Of course, it has SCMS.  All consumer decks do.  (So do Sony Minidiscs,
by the way.)

        Anyway, if you're interested, get in touch with bdavis@netcom.com.

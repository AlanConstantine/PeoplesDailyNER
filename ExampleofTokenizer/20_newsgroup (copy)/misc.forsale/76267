I would like to sell my PS/2 Model 50, with its Kingston SX/Now! 
33MHz processor, a Cyrix FasMath coprocessor (CPU/FPU LandMark 
scores of 46.6MHz/107.8MHz), 8 Meg (9 Meg total) on a AST 
Advantage/2 board (0 wait state), original 20 Meg hard drive, and a 
very fast Adaptec 1640 SCSI controller card (worth around $300 new) 
with software to control any external or internal SCSI device.  I'm 
including Dos 6.0 (or 5.0), and keyboard.  The VGA will drive any 
multisynching or straight VGA (cheap) monitor.

Please email me directly with inquiries/offers, so I can return my
phone # to you via email.

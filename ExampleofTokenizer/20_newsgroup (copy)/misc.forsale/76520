Hello again folks!
 
Been a while since I last sold thangs, but the last time went with no problems,
and I'm moving again, so I have a few keyboard stands that I don't need
anymore and don't want to drag back across the country.
 
---
Ultimate Support Stand:
 
**Probably SOLD, will see if it is gone by Saturday (pick-up date).
 
---
Rok-Steady 3-tier keyboard stand:
$95 or best offer (try me)
one x-shaped bottom unit, with two sets of "arms" that attach
to that to support keyboard (2) above the main "X". 
 
---
Shipping not included in the above prices, but details can be worked out
if you're interested in these items.

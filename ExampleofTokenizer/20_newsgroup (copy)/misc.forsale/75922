I have an Intel SatisFAXtion Modem/100 INTERNAL for sale.
It runs at 2400 baud data mode and up to 9600 baud as a Class 1 fax modem.
It transmits up to 9600 baud (V.29) and receives up to 4800 baud (V.27 ter.)

The modem has all original manuals and comes with software, icluding
  Intel's SatisFAXtion and FAXability, as well as Crosstalk Communicator

I have used this modem less than an hour.  It came with my computer and I
  already had another one.

I would like to ask $50 for this modem, but will entertain all serious offers.

Please email to jmu@acpub.duke.edu

Thanks.

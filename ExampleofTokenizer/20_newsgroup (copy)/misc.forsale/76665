I have an 8000S I'd like to sell.  Now that I'm finished with my TAing,
I don't have nearly as many appoints to miss, and I'd like to put the
money toward a laptop.

Asking $200.  I bought it last Christmas.  It's in great shape and
includes (as an added bonus!) a nice, padded leather carrying case.

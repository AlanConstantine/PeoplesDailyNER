COD is fine until the buyer opens the box to find they paid 150.00
for a brick. Or if it the seller allows for a personal check to be used
on a COD it's fine till a stop payment is made. There are few methods
to protect both buyer and seller in any sort of transaction. Even with
merchants and customers there are problems...stolen credit cards, 
chargebacks, no return policies and getting the wrong item, etc.

About the only protection available to to do business with someone you
trust....someone who has been around for a while.

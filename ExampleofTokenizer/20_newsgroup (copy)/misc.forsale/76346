Hey,
 
        I have a Color Watchman by SONY for sale. It is 6"x3"x1" in total
and the screen is 2.75" diagonal, over 2" wide, over 1.5" tall. I got it 2
years ago for $320, so I'm asking $160 obo.
 
        * VHF and UHF switch for channels 2 through 69.
        * slot for Audio/Video in from VCR (appropriate cord provided)
        * slot for phones
        * slot for A/C adaptor (A/C adaptor also provided)
        * slot for external Antenna (internal antenna provided)
        * On/Off switch
        * Manual Tuning, Volume, Brightness and Hue
        * Battery run as well (4 AA batteries provided)
 
It's been used very little. Looks like new. Email if interested.

   I have a 24-pin printer which is an ALPs Allegro24.  It's both a fast
printer with LQ and a very sophisticated design.  It has a straight paper
path and the capability of auto-forwarding sheets to tear off and then back
(a big paper saver as you never have to waste sheets to get a current
print out).  It can also handle single sheets without removing the formfeed
and has sophisticated preferences options (you can interactively program
all the preferences to control the printer and get printed feedback without
ever using a computer).  You get prompts and menus to pick your current setup
and default set up.  This was THE top of the line LQ dot matrix when I bought
it three years ago for $399.  It is also Epson LQ2500 compatible (besides it's
own modes) and comes with IBM driver software (which I've never used since I
own an Amiga).  Has a card slot for upgrading memory or fonts.

    I'll let it go for $150 including shipping prepaid.  COD orders must pay
all shipping and COD costs.

   Also a light gun and UFORCE controller for Nintendo but with PD driver
software to use them on the Amiga.  The light gun is fully remote (no wires).
Best offer over $75 ($30 less than my cost and they are both brand new).

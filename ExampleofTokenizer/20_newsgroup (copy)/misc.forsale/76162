Fellow netters,

I have an Okidata printer I would like to sell.  A description follows:

Okidata 180 printer including cables for both IBM compatibles (Centronics
parallel) and Commodore (RS-232 - round).  Also includes power cable, manual,
and a handful of computer paper to get you started.  This is a 9-pin printer. 
I recently cleaned the printhead and installed a new ribbon.  A print sample 
can be provided upon request.  This is a very dependable printer - it never
jams or does "weird" things.  I have used it with a Commodore for about 3 years
and am now using it with my 486sx.  I use mainly WordPerfect 5.1 (see next
post) for which I got a driver (at no charge) that directly supports the 
Okidata 180 in Epson FX mode. 

When I got the printer, it was selling for around $200-220 new (I got mine
from Tenex brand new - for a Christmas present).  I would like to get about
$100 or so for it.  If you are interested at all in it, please give me a ring
(E-Mail) and make an offer.

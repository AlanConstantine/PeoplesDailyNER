   I have a few the original IBM 10Mb harddisks for sale. They are actually
Seagate's ST412, MFM, full height,  has the IBM logo and black face plate. 
 
  Each disk is checked and formatted with DOS 5.0. It can be doubled to 
20Mb or so with dblspace or stacker if you so desire.  Have the original IBM
foam fitted boxies and anti-static bags. I am not sure if they were ever 
used, but each drive that is sent out will be quarenteed in good working order. 
 
 $30 each plus shipping cost, (about $5), 
 
  If you have one of those old IBM XT or PCs, this is for you !  It's cheaper
than a floppy drive !

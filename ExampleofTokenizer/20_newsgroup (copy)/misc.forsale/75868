Hello,
  I am looking for the Coleco Tablehockey games that were popular
in the 70's.  The games that I seek have straight slots for the
defenseman, not the S shaped slots.  The players are attatched to
rods operated with springs.  If you have a game(or games) that
you would be willing to part with, please send me an e-mail
message at U34815@uicvm.uic.edu.  Price is negotiable and
I would also cover shipping if you are out of state.  I am
part of a league that plays on a regular basis, the CTHL (The
Chicago Table Hockey League), and need a game to practice on.
Also, the league itself is always interested in purchasing
games to expand itself.
                                  Thank You,
                                         Ken Harris.

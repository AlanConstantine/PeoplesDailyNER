I just received a music software WinSong for Windows and found that it needs
a MIDI/sound card (Sound Blaster Pro is preferred) to have its fantastic
features show up. As I don't have the plan to add a sound card now, I am 
putting it here for sale. It's listed $79.95 on April issue of WINDOWS 
magazine and I paid $84.95 as the total. I am asking around $70 with shipping
included.

WinSong for Windows:

Composer, sequencer (tape deck), and Juke Box all in one.

It's a word processor for music - you can write and edit (cut, paste, move
and copy, etc) notes and symbols, play and print your composition.

It's graphical user interface works like a multi-track tape recorder.
Up to 64 musical tracks can be arranged for play, record, rewind, fast-forward
and stop.

It plays music on any MIDI compatible instrument - piano, guitar, drum set,
saxophone, clarinet, organ, and many.

You do not need to be a musician to use this software. The on-line manual
is handy. For musicians, it's great as writing music is not a tedious and
stifling aspect.

Almost NEW (one week OLD), unregistered
$70 (including shipping) OBO (please be reasonable)

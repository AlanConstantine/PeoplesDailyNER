I have recently purchased a PB170 and have no more use for my
RasterOps 8XL.  It has been a great card.  I should have traded it
with my IIci, but I forgot.  My forgetfulness si your gain.
Great 8 bit video that supports:

640x480 (Apple 13"/14")
640x870 (Apple Portrait)
800x600 (Silly DOS monitor resolution)
1024x768 (60hz & 75hz)
1152x870 (Apple 21")

Has hardware Pan & Zoom and supports virtual desktops up to the size of
2 Newspaper pages.  Includes standard Apple monitor cable or card to BNC,
you choose.

I am asking $250 (it's still advertised in MacWorld for up to $499). 
Completely negotiable.  I can get a monitor and sell the pair.  I will
accept offers for software or PowerBook accessory trades.
Make an offer.

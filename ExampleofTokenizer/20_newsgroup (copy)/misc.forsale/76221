That's one.  Any others?

Then they should have used a different advert.

I'm both.  I've made some $4k worth of PC products purchasing
decisions for one company I'm affiliated with in the past 6 months
alone.  (In a delicious bit of irony, an interesting fraction went to
suppliers that I suspect got my mailing address from these people.)
More is in the pipeline right now.

If they wanted to discuss these sorts of things, upfront is the
way to do it.

>When you get a catalog there's a "VIP Code" you

And who issues that "VIP Code"?  (That policy implementation in the
running for this week's "silly twit" award.)  BTW - It turns out that
I have several VIP codes.  Here's the one I'm using for these sorts of
things: "6".  (If you want one, send me mail and I'll put you in touch
with the folks who do the application interview; if you qualify....)

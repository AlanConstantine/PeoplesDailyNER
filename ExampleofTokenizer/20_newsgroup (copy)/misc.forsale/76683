This is a reposting 'cause two of the bags are out the door, and I took
dimensions of #1 and #5 (important to camcorder users).

    1. Large padded Cordura bag (maker unknown) orange exterior, black
	 straps and interior.  Five outside pockets plus lid compartment.
	 Lid overlaps.  Internal dividers can be repositioned.  Held
	 my whole 2-1/4 Bronica system, Metz flash, etc.  Main chamber
	 (not incl lid and pockets) is 18.5"W x 9"H x 7" D.  Very
	 strong bag, good for medium format users or videographers.

    2. Small "Nikon" shoulder bag. SORRY.  SOLD & SHIPPED.

    3. Small "Nikon" belt pouch.  Khaki like #2.  Similar in design to
	 US Army ammo pouch - belt clips, etc.  Holds flash or small
	 zoom (35-70) fixed lens, lens cleaner, etc.  $5.

    4. Domke belt pouch, black.  SORRY. SOLD & SHIPPED.

    5. Coast camera bag - tan with brown strap.  Main and front pocket.
	 Can hold AF slr with small zoom plus flash, film, etc. 10.5"H
	 x 9.5 H x 4.5 D plus 10.5" x 6.5 x 1.5 front pouch. It
	 looks like Gore-Tex but I don't think it really is. $15.

TERMS:  Payment in advance by money order/bank check, or cash.  Buyer
pays shipping.  #1 should go UPS.  For the others, send me an adequate
self addressed mailing envelope (padded recommended) with enough postage.
Please contact me by email if interested.

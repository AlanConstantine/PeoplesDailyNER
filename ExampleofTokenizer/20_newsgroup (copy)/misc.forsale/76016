I offer $100, shipment at seller's expense, payment as personal check
sent by U.S. mail within 24 hours after receiving goods.  I reserve the
right to return the goods, at my expense, if I find them to be defective
or otherwise unacceptable when I receive them (either the merchandise or
the check would be mailed within 24 hours).

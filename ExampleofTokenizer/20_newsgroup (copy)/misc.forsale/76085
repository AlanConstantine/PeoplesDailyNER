I am selling my FIAT 850 Spyder:

	This sleek little convertable has served me well through my past
year in San Diego, but I am going away for the summer and I have nowhere
to keep it, so on the aution block it goes.

	1971 Fiat 850 Sport
	White body
	White Hard Top (refurbished)
	Ivory Convertable Top (refurbished)
	New Black interior
	
	Come with high performance exhaust system
	Larger rebuilt engine (910 instead of 805)
	Car mats
	Smog checked, registered until 1994

This is the ultimate in San Diego driving. I will not guarantee that
this car will attract people to you of the opposite gender, but they
will ask for a ride. One warning, this is a high performance Italian
SPORTS car, if you want a boring little set of wheels this is NOT the
car for you, this car requires care. It has a manual choke, a 4-speed
manual transmision, manual throttle control, and even manual wiper
pump. If you KNOW how to drive then and only then can you appreciate
this car.

Feel free to inquire. The price is $1750 and all inspection has to be in
the San Diego area since school keeps me here all the time.

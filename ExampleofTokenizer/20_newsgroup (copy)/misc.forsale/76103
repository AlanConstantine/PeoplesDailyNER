There are many people want to buy my Kodak autofocus carousel projectors
but I don't have lenses or remote to sell.  They prefer to buy a projector
with all accessaries.  So I have to post another news asking for lenses
to fit those Kodak slide projectors:

I am willing to give away Singer Caramate II or Singer Caramete SP (
w/ built-in unremovable lens, built-in casette player, speaker, new 500 HR
bulb) try to trade for Kodak projector lenses.

Each projector (viewer) will equal trade for 1 or 2 Kodak projector lenses
depend on the focal length.  I will pay for the shipping for Singer 
projector (viewer).

Since I don't need those Singer projectors, if you have some 35mm SLR system
you don't need, I am willing to do the trade as well.

Yuesea

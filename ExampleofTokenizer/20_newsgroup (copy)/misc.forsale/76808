HE IS A CROOK.  DON'T DEAL WITH HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Please Help:

I am looking for Dana Weick.  A month ago I made a deal with him over the
net.  I was to sell him some memory, in exchang for $100 and a 486-66 cpu.
I thought the deal was great, so I went on with it.  

I sent him the memory COD FOR $100.  He was then suppose to send me the cpu.
I receive his COD payment on 4/8/93.  He send me a message the he sent the
cpu out 4/16/93.  It has been two weeks, and I didn't receive the CPU.

I send him numerous message asking for confirmation that the cpu was ship, or
what address he send it to (to make sure it didn't get lost in the mail.)
He never reply my mail.  

I finally resorted to calling him in Arizona.  The first call didn't get
throught, I got  an answering machine.  I left him my number.  He didn't reply.
I call again the next day and he pick up the phone.  I asked him if he had
send out the cpu.  He said yes, but he doesn't know what address he sent it
to.  

He said that you would check his record at home and call me back the next day.
To my suprise, He never called.  I then send him some more email messages, he
never reply again. (strang, when the deal was being made, he reply to every
of my message, now that He got my memory, He won't even reply to me.)

Now:  I am still calling him, but he won't pick up the phone.  I am also still
      emailing him, but he won't reply my mail.

So if any one know this DANA WEICK, please contact him.

Great, you can send the SIMMS to me at:
Dana Weick
4238 W Las Palmaritas
Phoenix, AZ  85051
(602) 925-6123 (days) (602) 842-2145 (evenings)

I would prefer US Mail, 2nd Day Priority (it only costs $2.90)

The CPU is brand new, install it correctly (meaning don't plug it in
backwards or bend any pins) and I'll warranty it for 6 months.
Thanks

****ON 4/8 I SEND HIM AND SAID...
that I got the cod payment.
and asked if the cpu is sent out yet
>Is the CPU sent out yet?
****HE REPLIED.....ON 4/9

Glad the COD payment got to you OK, the CPU has been sent so keep your eyes out
for it.  Be *very* careful when you install it, be careful of static discharge,
bending pins during insertion and above all make absolutely certain you
plug the chip in the proper orientation.  The chip was checked out prior to
shipping and if you cook it by plugging it in backwards I won't be real
sympathetic! 
 
If you don't know how to tell what orientation the chip should be installed, 
DON'T GUESS!


********************************DANA WEICK UPDATE:****************************

I call him sunday, his wife Debbie picked up the phone.  She said that he was 
busy with his kids, and he would call me back in 10 minuets.  Half an house
went by, Weick didn't called.  I called him again, and his phone was discon-
nected.

Since this post,  I have numberous people who mail me saying that this DANA
WEICK have ripped them off.  We got do something about this guy.  He has
appearrently been doing this for a few years now.  And he is getting away
with it.

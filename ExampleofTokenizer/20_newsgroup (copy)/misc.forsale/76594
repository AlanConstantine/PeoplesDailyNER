Hey,

collection.  I am interested in buying any in good condition.  I am 
particularly interested in any of the older, exotic models (eg five ] 
transformers into one etc...  I am looking at paying around $20-$40 depending
upon the model, size and original cost etc.  I will also pay airmail postage
and packing.  I am also happy to buy any old sci-fi related toys eg robots,
rocketships, micronauts etc... There is only one catch.  I live in New
Zealand so you have to be willing to post the items there.  I hop that
someone can help me out. 


Cheers

Darren

Hi,

Since the original buyer found out he couldn't use this modem
for his Mac (I beleive I mentioned that it's an internal in my
former post), the modem is re-available now.  This modem is
SupraFaxModem V.32bis.  If interested, please e-mail.

Thanks!

PS: I am sorry I already lost those e-mails stated interested
    in this modem.  If you all are still interested, please
    e-mail me again.

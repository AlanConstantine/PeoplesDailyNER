I have a set of four 235-60-R14 Big O tires that I had on my 1988 Thunder 
Bird. We bought them and then traided the car in. They would not give me 
anything for them so I had them taken off. We drove about 2,000 miles on 
them. They are 40,000 mile tires. They are sporty looking low-profile, and 
take corners realy well. If you are interested please contact me at (208)384-
9236 OR DUSMADSO@IDBSU.IDBSU.EDU I am in IDAHO. USA

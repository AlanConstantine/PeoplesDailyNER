	I have the following Laser Discs forsale.  All are in original covers.  They are all in excellent condition,  I've watched them so many times and I can't see myself watching them again.  I'm asking $20 per disc.

Terminator
Road Warrior
Hook
Ghost
Robo Cop
Repo Man
Romancing the Stone
Lost Boys
Dark Man
Robinhoood Prince of Thieves
Total Recall

	I ask $3 for S&H for the first laser disc, if you buy more than one the $3 will cover them all.

          SWELL ITEMS FOR SALE - HARDLY ANY COMPUTER STUFF

o LOTUS 1-2-3 Student Edition for DOS ...................... $10.00
     This does just about everything that standard 1-2-3
     Release 2.01 could do, but not as much of it.  Worksheet 
     size is limited to 64 columns by 256 rows, there is no
     translation facility (for importing data from other
     packages), and the Student Edition does not write files 
     that can be accessed by Release 2.01.  Includes manual,
     original distribution diskettes (5 1/4" - 360K), and key
     board templates.


o Subaru Service Manuals ................................... $10.00
     This is not a complete set, but includes sections 4, 5 
     & 6 which cover MECHANICAL COMPONENTS (suspension, wheels 
     & axles, steering, brakes, pedals & control cables, heater 
     & ventilator, air conditioning), BODY (body & exterior, 
     doors & windows, seats, seat belts, interior, instrument 
     panel), and ELECTRICAL (engine electrical system, body 
     electrical system, wiring diagram, and trouble-shooting). 
     These are the genuine Subaru issue manuals.  They are for 
     model year 1986, but have plenty of good information that 
     applies to other years as well.


o Miscellaneous Darkroom Equipment ........................ $75.00
     Solar enlarger (several objective lenses) with easel and 
     timer, negative carriers for 35mm and 2 1/4 x 3 1/4, misc.
     printing masks.  Developing tanks, thermometer, trays, 
     constant-temperature bath, ground glass, mirrors, darkroom
     lamps, glassware, el-cheap-o tripods..... and (as they say)
                             MUCH   MORE!


o Beautiful Antique Buffet ............................... $1500.00
     Solid cherry (no veneer).  Handmade, with very interesting
     dovetail corners in the drawers.  Built (we think) around 
     1880.  Not gaudy or covered with gew-gaws; a simple, elegant 
     piece of furniture, but too big (60" long, 37" tall, 24" 
     deep) for our little Cape Cod house.


Will deliver pricier items (ie, over $10) anywhere in the Rochester 
area.  (And will consider delivering the others.)  Will deliver any 
of it on (or near) UofR Campus between now and graduation.

	I have a pair of AKG 340s in nearly new condition for sale.  They
have been used in my studio for mixdown monitoring.  I have the original box.
The 340s use both an electret element and a dynamic element in each ear cup
with built-in crossovers.  They have a very smooth frequency response and
the electrostatic element gives clearer highs.  I am asking $200 for the
pair.

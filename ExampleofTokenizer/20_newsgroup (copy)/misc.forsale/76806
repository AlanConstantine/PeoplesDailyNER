Subject: CDTV, Accessories, 1084s Monitor.

Because of the 'questionable' bids being placed for the set-up, I am
including some 'guideline' prices in this REPOST. Negotiable, of course.

In anticipation of the arrival of my new computer system, I am
selling my CDTV and accessories.  I am in no rush to sell this
so if you don't have the money now, but may be able to get it in
a few weeks, make a bid and let me know.

I am NOW willing to sell the pieces separately, but I will wait to sell
until they are all accounted for (at least CDTV and Keyboard Kit)
I will sell the monitor separately.

CDTV  (6 months old. Mint condition. Comes with all documentation,
      packaging, receipt, etc, all in mint condition. Demo disc.)
      ----->I will start bidding at $375 for this

CDTV Keyboard Package [Keyboard, mouse, 3.5" drive] (Comes with all
      documention, packaging, receipt etc. 6 months old. Mint
      turns your CDTV into a full fledged AMIGA 500 computer!)
      ----->I will start bidding at $125 for this

1084s Monitor (A couple years old. Very Good condition. Comes with
       all documentation, packaging, and receipt if I can find it.)
      ----->I will start bdding at $125 for this

Software (Various titles...games, demos, etc. NOTE: I have no CDTV
          discs. All software is 3.5" disc based).
      ----->FREE with PACKAGE deal.

Please send your best bid to io00844@maine or call (207)-581-7589.
Ask for Zero Batzell. You can leave a message if I'm not in.

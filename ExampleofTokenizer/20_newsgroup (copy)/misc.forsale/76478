Hallo all...my girlfriend and I will be travelling across the US this summer,
so we won't be using our tickets to return to Hawaii.  Please buy them.

The tickets are one-way, leaving Peoria, IL on May 17.  It connects to the main
route in Minneapolis/St. Paul, and from there goes on to Honolulu...you'll be
in Honolulu at 2:42 pm, and flying via Northwest airlines.

Any offers will be considered, but please make sure these are serious offers.
Tickets to Hawaii aren't cheap, but we're aiming to make two people very happy
this summer.

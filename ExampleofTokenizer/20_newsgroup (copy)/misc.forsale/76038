FOR SALE:

* Besler 23C II Enlarger 
     (including filters & negative carriers)

* Darkroom supplies 
     (containers, trays, thermometer, beakers, 
     paper focuser, etc...I also have paper & 
     chemicals, but I think these 2 are past 
     expiration date)


Everything is in great working condition.  I bought it 
about a year ago and it has served its purpose well.  
It hasn't been used it in a few months because I don't 
have the time or money to keep up with it and its just 
sitting in my bathroom taking up space I'd like to use.
So, I'd like to sell it to someone who would use it 
rather than it collect dust in my bathroom.

If you are interested in the whole package, I will sell 
everything (including shipping) for $300.  If you have 
something else in mind, I'm open to suggestions.

Please reply to this account.

Thank you...
Michelle

Looking for an amateur radio operator that needs a variable power linear
amplifier for 2-30MHz.  Looks and works like new.  Runs off 12v for mobile
use.  Input: 5-10 watts  Output: ~175 watts AM, ~350 watts PEP SSB.
I need $150 out of it.

If that's too much, I also have a Tornado 100 that takes 5w in and
100/250w out for $100.

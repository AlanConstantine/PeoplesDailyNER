I have an Altos 2000 System V.3 Unix system for sale (I actually have two,
but one's for me). Several years ago these well-known machines sold for
$30,000 for the base configuration. This particular one has much more than the
base configuration, depending on what you want:

- 386 16 MHZ CPU.
- 8 meg of ram.
- Fifteen (15) serial ports (or more if you want)!
- A multidrop port for up to 256 more serial ports!
- Ethernet.
- 5.25" floppy drive.
- QIC 24 cartridge tape drive.
- 170 meg ESDI hard drive (either Micropolis or CDC, or both if you want).
- Unix System V.3 installation.
- Networking software package (TCP/IP).
- Development system software package (C compiler and libraries).

I am asking only $700 (firm) for the system! If you want another Ethernet or
serial card, add $50. Additional disks are $100 each (I can install a total of
three ESDI drives). I would consider a trade for a SCSI DAT tape drive.

This box would make a great BBS system or terminal server. It was originally
designed to service 40 active users, and up to 70 moderately active users.
This is NOT a PC! It was designed to be a Unix box from the start, and it's
very fast and exceptionally reliable.

It's dimensions are approximately 2.5' high (tower), 8" wide and 2" deep.

I am only interested in dealing with someone local enough to come pick it up.
Shipping is way too much hassle. Call if you wish, or send email.

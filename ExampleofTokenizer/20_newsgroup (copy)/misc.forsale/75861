Oh, dear.  Let me be the first on my block.

You have just violated one of the major shibboleths of the Usenet groups:
you're not supposed to use a newsgroup to plug your own commercial
enterprise (of _any_ kind; people frequently get flamed for announcing
they've got a new book out.)

I don't know whether this is an official Usenet rule or just a long-
standing custom, and it doesn't make much difference from a practical
point of view.

So please don't do it again.

And all you others, who are even now taking keyboard in hand to flame
him off the face of the earth--lay off.  He didn't know any better.
He does now.

      Agreed.  I have yet to run into a problem in deals over the net
      and I have bought things from CDs (plenty!) to a full computer.
      The only small problem that I have had was with UPS rather than
      the seller.  Besides, complaints are always what get the
      publicity....when something goes wrong, people complain.  Rarely
      have I seen posts stating how well a deal went through.  I guess
      Kevin is practically a first!

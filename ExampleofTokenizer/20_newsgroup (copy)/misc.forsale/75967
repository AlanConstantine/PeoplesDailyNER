Since I have some free time while looking for a job I thought 
I would offer Linux on disk and tape for those who need it.


NOTE: I am offering this service for EXPERIENCED users who 
require no support.  Simply put I am just a disk shuffler.  If 
you think you will need support I HIGHLY recommend  
Softlanding Linux System (SLS) directly.  They provide an
excellent product at a decent price with support.

I am the lazy mans service, for those who don't want to spend 
4 hours on the modem and 2 hours shuffling floppies.  And 
those who don't need SLS support and opt to go it alone.

What you get... each disk is $1.50(5.25) 
                             $1.75(3.5)       (14 disk minimum).

A Minimal System     : 4 Disks   6.00/7.00
B Base System Extras : 7 Disks   10.50/12.25
C Compilers          : 3 Disks   4.50/5.25
D Documentation      : 2 Disks   3.00/3.50
S Source, misc.      : 1 Disk    1.50/1.75
T TeX                : 3 Disks   4.50/5.25
X X-Windows          : 8 Disks   12.00/14.00


Entire set %5 discount: 40.00/46.50

or the entire set on QC-40 tape for 40.00

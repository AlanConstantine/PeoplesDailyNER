* 92,000 miles, all highway (I used to commute 160 miles/day)
* 5 speed
* Air Conditioning
* AM/FM/Cassette stereo
* split fold-down rear seat
* 2.2 liter, 12 valve, fuel injected engine 
* roomy interior, comfy back seats, big trunk
* well maintained - oil and filter every 3,000 - 4,000, other maintanence
	as scheduled.  Except for the timing belt which still looks new.
	I did slip and went 5,000 miles without changing the oil once.
* tires have 20,000 miles, lots of life left (probably 30,000 to 40,000)
* front brake job at 84,000, back brakes are still good
* engine/trans/drive train in perfect condition - everything works,
	nothing needs replacing, next tune up scheduled at 120,000
* body is good - left tail light is cracked (I'm trying to find a used
	one - dealer wants $172!), two long scratches and a ding on the
	hood (vandalism?), a bunch of stone chips on the front of the
	hood.  Official Mazda touch up paint included in the deal.

This car is extremely reliable, even better than the Toyota Corolla it
replaced.  Besides the tires, brakes and maintanence items, the only other
parts that have been replaced are the headlight bulbs.

Selling because my wife refuses to drive a car without an automatic trans.
And she wants a station wagon with a sun roof, etc, etc.

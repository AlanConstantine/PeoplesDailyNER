Recently I got a case of Hot Shots '93 cards.  Unfortunately I had
not planned on keeping all of them.  I sort of got stuck with the
case.  (I'm not going to mention any names, though.)

So, I am trying to sell off most or all (minus a set for myself).

If you have any interest in a set, a box, or any singles, please let
me know.

The set has 250 cards.  Each card features a great looking woman in
various stages of dress.  Some nude, semi-nude, lingerie, dressed.
99 percent are gorgeous, I feel.

There are 4 subsets:

Girl, Girl, Girls   1 through 9
Promo cards   251 through 259 (also numbered 1 of 9 through 9 of 9)
Emperor's All-Stars   269 through 277
Stripping Empress   260 through 268

Also, I am supposed to be getting some holograms soon as well.

Oh, and lastly, I have a very few error cards and a few cards
that were originally intended to be used as card #1, but the
company changed their mind.  None of these cards are easy to get.

Anyway, if you have some interest in any of these cards, please
drop me a line, as I am most eager to sell a bunch off.

Oh, and if you are interested, I also have 1 set of Hot Shots '92
left, and about 2 sets of California Dreaming cards as well.

And lastly, I have promo cards for all of the cards I have
mentioned, and holograms as well.  Not a lot, though.

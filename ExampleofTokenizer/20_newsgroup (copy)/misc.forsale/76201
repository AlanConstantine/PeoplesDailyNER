Sounds a little odd but I sold an Amiga hand scanner to
an elementary school teacher in south Florida (Miami, I
think) but I have just recently found that I still have
the scanner manual.  The original shipment included the
software manual, disks, packaging, etc.

Basically, I have since lost the name & address of the 
person I  sold it to...and I would like to get it to him.

If that person sees this, please send me an email to:

dlneal@cbda9.apgea.army.mil

thanx, and sorry for taking up net space.

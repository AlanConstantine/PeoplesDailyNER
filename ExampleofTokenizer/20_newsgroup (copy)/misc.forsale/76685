It's basement cleaning time.  This stuff has got to go.

I have two boxes of 9 track 2400' tapes, around 20 tapes/box.  They are
free to anyone who wants to come by and pick them up.  They've seen
very little use.  If anyone wants these bad enough to ship, they're yours
for the cost of shipping, the cod charge and a $10 nusiance fee.

I have a lot of serial cables.  I have all kinds, ribbon, shielded, long,
short M-M, M-F whatever you want.  Most appear to work well with PC serial
ports, but I will not gaurantee that.  Tell me what you want and I'll do
the best I can to match.  1.50 ea or 10/$10.  Shipping included.  No CODs
under $20.  (You want to pay a $5 COD charge for a $1.50 cable?  Go buy
the cable at your local computer store instead, it'll be cheaper.)  I believe
these cables were removed from service at a computer center.  They appear
to be in good condition and the ones I have used have worked well.

I also have a 15 KVA Exide UPS with batteries that needs minor repair, probably
a logic board.  It weighs about 280 pounds and is 36 inches high.  I think
they used to run a Prime system off of it.  Best offer over $75, but you 
need to come pick it up.  Use this to run your house from your solar panels.

I will consider reasonable offers on any of this stuff.

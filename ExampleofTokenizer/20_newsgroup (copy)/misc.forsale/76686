 I'm looking for an old album or cassette tape. The group is Sanford/Townsend
the name of the album is 'Smoke from a Distant Fire' (I think). This album
came out somewhere around  1975-76, and I believe was the first album produced
by Kenny Loggins after he and Jim Messina broke up.

If you happen to have this album and are willing to part with it, great. If
you don't want to part with it, but are willing to copy it onto cassette I'd
love that too.

Thanks

JK

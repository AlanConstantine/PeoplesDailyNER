"Bare" means what it says. You get a case, a power supply, and a motherboard
(with RAM and a coprocessor). *Everything* else is yours to add as you like.

The case/power supply:
  
     - Standard desktop case. 230watt power supply with the usual connectors.
     - Room for five floppy/hard drives (three visible, two internal).

The motherboard:

    - US-made Micronics 8-slot motherboard with Intel 386dx/25mhz CPU
    - 64kb SRAM cache
    - 4mb 80us RAM using 4x1mb simms (worth $150 alone)
    - Cyrix 83D87 math coprocessor (worth $90 alone)
    - Norton SI 6.0 rating of 26.1
    - Latest version Phoenix BIOS


Please do not post/email saying "but I can get a Taiwanese SuperClone
386/90 for only $9.95 including a free toaster!". I am *certain* you can
find a cheaper Brand X board without even breaking a sweat. *New* Micronics
CPUs command a several-hundred dollar premium because they are US-made,
use high-quality components, and are known to be both very reliable and
compatible. They have been OEMed in systems sold by both Gateway and
Zeos at various points in the past. (Check out the ads in the back pages
of Byte or PC Magazine if you want to see this price differential for
yourself.)

Price: $495 complete, $100 less if you don't want/need the case and
power supply. The board is fully guaranteed. Email for further details
or for any questions.

Thanks!

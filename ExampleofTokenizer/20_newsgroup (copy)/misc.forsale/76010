   After hearing about the McGovern House story on Paul Harvey I never had any
idea how much it was worth.  The autograph is on a Senate Pass card
and is signed 'John Kennedy.'  I don't remember if it was signed 
'Senator John Kennedy' or whether or not it was dated, because I haven't
looked at it in quite a while.  Currently it is in a safety deposit box.
I would rather sell to a private collector rather then go through an auction
house such as Christy's since that would tend to take away from the profit. 
If you (or any collector you may know) has an interest in this please send
me an e-mail expressing your interest.  I will see what I can do to make 
a scanned gif of it available to prospective buyers.

	I have the following IBM hardware forsale

	ATI VgaWonderXl24 -  This is a great card, it supports 1024x768 256 colors, 800x600 32k colors, and 640x480 16 million colors.  I found that it also speed up windows considerably.  I'm asking $100 o.b.o. for this card.


	I also have 2 2400 baud modems.  I have Docs for both but I don't have the original boxes.  Both work fine and I'd like to get $25 each or $40 for both.

	Please e-mail all replies to jth@bach.udel.edu
	Thanks,
	Jay

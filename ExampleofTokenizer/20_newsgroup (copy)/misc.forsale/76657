I have 9 of these mice which are just taking up space in my
office.  Please buy them.  The price is only $11 and it
will only cost you 2.90 to ship USPS if you prepay.
Here is all I know about them:
Mice 2-button high resolution 400cpi 

The mice are acutally quite comfortable, much like the new
hp ergo mouse.  Snugs the hand.

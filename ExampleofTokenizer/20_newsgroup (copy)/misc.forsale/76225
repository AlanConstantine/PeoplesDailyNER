Hmmm... Interesting. What do you mean by WALKING distance? I lived in
Moscow for 21 years, and if I am 5 minutes walk to Belorusskaya
subway station, I CANNOT be walking distance to Kremlin. Unless
1 hour of walking is what you mean. By the way, what is
the price? I may plan a trip there (not sure yet, though) in
late summer.

Hi folks

Say, I'm new to R5 and have one quick question.

In using xon ( xon  <machine_name> )  , I notice that it
always comes up with a very small window .  I'm pretty
sure its the default font.  My xterms all work normally.
Is xon supposed to read your .Xresources for a font size ?

xrdb -q appears to show the right stuff.

I can use xon with arguments such as  xterm -fn 10x20    etc
and everything is correct.  Of course you could always do a 
simple script to do this , but I have a feeling I'm missing
something simple here.

Comments / suggestions appreciated.

Thanks in advance

Bob

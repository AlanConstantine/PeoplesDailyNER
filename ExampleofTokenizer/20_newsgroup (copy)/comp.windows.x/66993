I want to do the equivalent of an "xwininfo -name" via a call or set of calls
in Xlib.  I need to map a windows name to its id.
It's probably easy, but I've only been programming in X for a little while.
I've looked in the O'reilly books and didn't find it and I also checked the
FAQ and couldn't find it.

Email to one of the following addresses and I'll post a response if it
seems reasonable to do so.

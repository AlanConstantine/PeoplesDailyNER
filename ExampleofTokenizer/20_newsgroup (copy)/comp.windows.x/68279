	I got a few requests asking for a summary, so I'll attempt one
here:


	Here's the ones I know of:

	Wind/U		- Bristol Technologies

	Hunter SDK	- Hunter Systems

	MainWin		- MainSoft

	LIBWXM          - Visual Solutions


	Hunter 

	The company is going through some big changes.  I expect
to eventually see the Hunter SDK pop up with a new name.  At the moment, it
is difficult to get phone calls returned and otherwise obtain info.
Hopefully they will post something about themselves once things settle down. 

	Visual Solutions

	LIBWXM is a product that I just heard about.  They don't
yet support MDI or MFC.  Libwxm was used to port VisSim, a mathematical
modeling package.  Does native Motif Widgets, like Wind/U from Bristol.
Contact Carrie Lemieux at 508 392 0100 for more info.  She's very helpful.

	MainSoft

	This translates Windows source to a Unix executable that
can switch off between a Windows or Quasi-Motif look and feel at
runtime.  They skip the Xt and Xm (Motif) X toolkit levels and go
straight to Xlib.  They don't yet support MFC.  They're at 415 896 0708.

	Bristol

	This company that seems to be on the right track.  Wind/U uses
Xlib/Xt/Xm to give a *real* Motif app.  They seem to be doing the most work
in trying to support things like DDE, Common Dialogs, and more on the horizon.
My contact there is knowledgeable, responds to my email, and wrote an example
program for me showing how to obtain X widgets from Windows handles.
They're at 203 438 6969, or you can email info@bristol.com.

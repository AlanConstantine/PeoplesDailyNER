Here's what I (think) have figured out.  All I need to do is install
the R5 disitribution without the Xserver like the sony.cf file defines,
and all the new libraries, utils, etc., will be installed and my old
server from r4 will still work.  This will allow me to run Xview 3.0,
and have X11r5 up and running.  Does the server interface remain the
same with all changes made only to the libs?

Another question: Is it likely that since Sun is dropping OW support
that the desktop utils (like the file manager) will be made public?
It would be nice if companies would make old code public for the
benefit of those of us with smaller budgets. :)

Glad to hear that it's working for you!

I couldn't find it on "export".  However, Simon Leinen
<simon@liasun6.epfl.ch> has added an Imakefile and an Athena
version, and made it available for FTP in the file
liasun3.epfl.ch:/pub/X/contrib/xrpc.tar.z.  (Note the ".z"
suffix; you'll need GNU gzip -- also on liasun3 in /pub/gnu --
to uncompress it.)  

If this doesn't work, send me a note and I'd be happy to mail you
a copy; but you probably won't get it until the start of May --
I'm on holidays as of tomorrow! :-)

P.S. Are there any Dublin X folks that want to go for a pint of
Guinness at, say, Mulligan's...?

One usual suggestion is to put everything into your every-time shell rc-file
instead of your login-only one, which is fair enough if you only have a few
users who know what they're doing.  If you have several hundred users who do
what the books tell them, though, then it's confusing at best.  Another is to
have your xterms run login shells, but that still leaves the window manager
and the things that get started from its menus with the wrong environment.

Our alternative is that instead of having xdm run the client startup scripts,
it runs the user's favourite shell as a login shell, and has *it* then run the
rest of the startup scripts.  That way the user's usual environment gets set
up as normal and inherited by everything.  You can find an almost-current copy
of our scripts and things in contrib/edinburgh-environment.tar.Z, available
from the usual places.

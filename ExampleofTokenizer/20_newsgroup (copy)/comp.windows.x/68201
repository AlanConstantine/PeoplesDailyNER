Due it seems to Sun's crapulous organisation of the X libraries and includes,
most standard (GNU and other) software won't compile out of the box (well, tar
file). 

Right now I'm trying to make ghostview. It complains it can't find X11/XaW/...
so I just linked (ln -s) the files from /usr/openwin/share/include/X11 and 
now the ghoddam thing _still_ complains it can't find them.

I still haven't been able to compile xdvi, not no way.

Has anyone _ever_ managed to get _anything_ normal to compile on a Sun
(SunOS 4.1.3 and OpenWindows 3)? What's the trick I'm missing? I've even 
tried hard copying all the relevant files into the "right" places and
every time, there's some bit missing or it refuses to find it.

To incrementally update the contents of windows, I use the following trick:

	1. Set the window background to None,
	2. Call XClearArea(display, window, 0, 0, 0, 0, True),
	3. Restore the window background to its correct value.

The call to XClearArea does not repaint the window background, but still
generates exposure events for visible parts of the window.

In order to let my application know that these expose events must be handled
incrementally (something is already displayed on the screen and may need to
be erased), I encapsulate the 3 operations with 2 self addressed client
messages, which preserve asynchronicity between the client and the server.

XGrabServer(display)
client message (start-incremental)
 	background None
	XClearArea
	Restore background 
client message (end-incremental)
XUngrabServer(display)

The GrabServer prevents other events to be inserted by the server in the
critical section.

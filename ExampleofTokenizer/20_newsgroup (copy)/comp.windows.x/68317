Take a look at TeleUSE, a complete UIMS from Alsys (formerly TeleSoft).
In the US, you can reach them at (619) 457 2700.

Alsys have an VMS version of TeleUSE v2.0.5 for VMS V5.5 or higher,
built using DECwindows Motif 1.0 (based on X11R4 and Motif v1.1.1).

BTW, the VMS port from the UNIX version was made at my company, and was
released in November 1992.

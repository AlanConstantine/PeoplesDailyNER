I received similar information/advice about what appears to be the same problem 
Benjamin has (and I still have).
NIS has all the information about the Macs
(I even put explicit entries in /etc/hosts to no avail).
Monitoring with 'snoop' on my Classic, the initial REXEC packet is sent to
the the SUN, which sends something to the correct Mac, but nothing appears
at the Mac.
'rexecd' is number one suspect, but it's more suble than the README suggests and
I haven't yet looked into it further.

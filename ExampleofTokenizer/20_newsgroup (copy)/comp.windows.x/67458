Hello,

	I am admin for an RS/6000 running AIX 3.2, X11R5, Motif, and xdt3.
	I want to prevent the user from hitting CNTL-ALT-BKSPC to exit X.
	
	I've tried invoking X with 'xinit -T', but that doesn't work.
	xinit appends the -T to the call to .xinitrc, and not to the
	call to X.  

	The man page to xinit is no help.  In fact, it tells
	me that xinit is a script when it is really a binary file.  

	So far, the only way I've been able to accomplish this feat is
	to add the -T to the call to X in /usr/lpp/X11/defaults/xserverrc.
	I would rather not do it this way.  Does anyone have any other ideas?

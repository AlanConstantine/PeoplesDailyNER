#No doubt this is an old question, but I didn't find the answer in the
#FAQs I could find, so - here goes:
#
#I have a Sunview application that I want to convert to X (OpenLook,
#Motiv, whatever). I remember hearing quite some time ago that there
#are tools to accomplish this task.
#
#	a) is that so?
#	b) are they public domain?
#	c) any good, i.e.
#	d) advantages over reimplementing the interface myself?
#

The simple answer is for you to obtain use XView to do this.  XView is a
one to one replacement for Sunview.  It should already be provided with
you Sun running OpenWindows.   It is also free available as part of the
contrib side of the MIT X11R5 release.

Announcing xmgr (ACE/gr, Motif version) v2.10

Xmgr is a full-featured XY-plotting tool for UNIX workstations 
using X or OpenWindows. There is an XView version called xvgr for
Suns. Collectively, these 2 tools are known as ACE/gr. Compiling 
xmgr requires the Motif toolkit version 1.1 and X11R4 - xmgr will 
not compile under X11R3/Motif 1.0x.  X11R5+Motif 1.2 should work 
fine, but I've not been able to test this.

For a summary of xmgr's capabilities, get the file BLURB from
either site mentioned below.

Available via anonymous ftp to either:

ftp.ccalmr.ogi.edu:/CCALMR/pub/acegr/xmgr-2.10.tar.Z

or

export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/acegr/xmgr-2.10.tar.Z

Please remember to set the transfer type to binary.

I am not able to E-mail xmgr, but there are services provided 
by various Internet sites that allow ftp by mail. You might try 
sending mail to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com as follows:

Subject: (hit return) Body-of-letter: help (return) quit

I've not tried this, but it should give you instructions on how 
to use this service.

2.10 has been compiled and tested on:

 IBM RS6000 - AIX 3.2 X11R4/Motif 1.1
 DECstation - Ultrix 4.2a X11R4/Motif 1.1
 SGI Indigo - Irix 4.0.1 X11R4/Motif 1.1
 Sun SPARC  - SunOS 4.1.1 X11R4/Motif 1.1
 HP 720     - HP-UX 8.05 X11R4/Motif 1.1

Compiling with gcc should be no problem, but use settings 
appropriate for K&R C.

Of interest:

In light of recent announcements (COSE), I'm suspending further 
development of the XView version. For those without Motif on 
SUNs, I'll provide a compiled binary (eventually).

I've begun re-writing ACE/gr in C++, the initial target is
MS-Windows.

Improvements/fixes from 2.09 are:

 * The explicit placement of items in popups has been replaced
	with manager widgets. The previous method led to problems
	on some servers (all widgets in a popup would get scrunched
	into the upper left corner).

 * Many set operations can now be done in the File/Status popup.

 * The PostScript driver should do a better job of producing
	EPSF'able output.

A few things remain to do (I could use some ideas/help on these):

1. Replace the Hershey fonts used for on-screen text with the
	xvertext routines posted to the net by Alan Richardson.
	The problem here is how to include support for this in the
	user interface.

2. Add support for Adobe Font Metrics. I could use some PD or freely
	distributable routines for this.

3. Add support for pattern fills in the PostScript driver. Presently
	the only way to get hardcopy for fills is to import MIF into
	FrameMaker. Need PS routines for pattern fills.

4. Add support for HDF/NetCDF. I'm interested in your opinion on
	how one would write a generic reader for these file formats.

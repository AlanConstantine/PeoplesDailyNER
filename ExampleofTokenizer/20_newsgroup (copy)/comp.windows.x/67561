I've installed many X apps, and have that many of them Imakefiles that have
lines startingwith XCOMM in them. When I do a xmkmf to create the Makefile,
the Makefile also has the XCOMM (comment?) lines in them. I always have
to edit out these lines because the make command barfs on them. I was
wondering what these lines were for, and what I might be doing wrong that
causes the make command to dislike them. Thanks!

Most graphics systems I have seen have drawing routines that also specify
a color for drawing, like

Drawpoint(x,y,color) or Drawline(x1,y1,x2,y2,color) or
Fillrectangle(x1,y1,x2,y2,color) 

With X, I have to do something like 
XSetForeground(current_color)
XDrawPoint(d,w,x,y)

Why split this into two functions? Why did X designers decide to not associate
the color with the object being drawn, and instead associate it with the
display it is being drawn on?

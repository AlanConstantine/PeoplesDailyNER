Extract from the color README file for Anthony's Icon Library.
For Network discussion...

Color Coordination...

    I tried to start a discussion in `comp.windows.x' at the start of the
  year about some sort of `standard color table' that icons should follow
  (say 16 to 32 colors including 5 colors for a small grey scale). but no
  one responded at all.

    The problem is that if the colors for icons are just used willy-nilly
  you will soon find that the workstations color table, devotes itself
  solely the window manager, icons and other `adminstrative tasks' instead
  of applications that actually require the colors for proper working.
  ``Color needful applications'' such as :  Picture and graphic displayers,
  Animation, Real Time video, Raytracers, etc... .

    The following is a suggested color table for icons, and general use.
  Icons, Window Managers, and general applications, should follow this
  table or something like it, UNLESS the application is ``color needful''.

     * for each primary color (red,green,blue) three colors
             EG: values   0, 128 and 255.
       This results in  3 ^ 3  colors (27) representing most of the
       standard colors for use in icons.

     * two extra shades of grey
             EG: vales    (black) 0, 64, 128, 196 and 255 (white,red,...)

     * 3 other colors -- probably of some primary color to provide shading
       a and 3-D look to buttons and titlebars in the window manager.

    This table represents 32 colors and represents a large range of
  posibilities for the above ``administrative services'' of the
  workstation.

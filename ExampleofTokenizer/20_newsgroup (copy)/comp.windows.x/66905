I posted about this a while ago but without code excerpts noone was 
able to help me.

The problem is that main_win.win is doing fine, but when I create 
detail_win.win, it does not receive it's initial expose events until 
main_win.win receives an event. Here are the relevent calls:

main_win.win = XCreateSimpleWindow (mydisplay, DefaultRootWindow(mydisplay),
                myhint.x, myhint.y, myhint.width, myhint.height,
                main_win.line_thick, fg, bg);
XSetStandardProperties(mydisplay, main_win.win, main_win.text,
                main_win.text, None, argv, argc, &myhint);
main_win.gc = XCreateGC (mydisplay, main_win.win, 0, 0);
XMapRaised (mydisplay, detail_win.win);
XMapSubwindows (mydisplay, main_win.win);
The event mask for main_win is:
	PPosition | PSize | StructureNotifyMask | ExposureMask| KeyPressMask | 
	EnterWindowMask | LeaveWindowMask;
The flags are
	PPosition | PSize

I then create detail_win.win with the following calls (hints has new values):
detail_win.win = XCreateSimpleWindow (mydisplay, DefaultRootWindow(mydisplay),
                myhint.x, myhint.y, myhint.width, myhint.height,
                detail_win.line_thick, fg, bg);
XSetStandardProperties(mydisplay, main_win.win, detail_win.text,
                detail_win.text, None, argv, argc, &myhint);
detail_win.gc = XCreateGC (mydisplay, detail_win.win, 0, 0);
XMapRaised (mydisplay, detail_win.win);
Event Mask and flags are identical to main_win's flags and event mask.


If anybody has any idea why the initial expose events of detail_win.win 
are not received until main_win.win receives an event I'd love to hear 
from them. Other that that everything works great so there must be some 
detail I'm overseeing.

Thanks for any tips

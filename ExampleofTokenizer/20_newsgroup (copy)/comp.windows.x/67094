The COSE announcement specifies that Motif will become the common
GUI. But what does this mean exactly? 

- Do they mean that all "COSE-complient" apps will have the Motif
  look and feel?

- Do they mean that all "COSE-complient" apps will use the Motif
  toolkit API?

- Do they mean both of the above?

- Is it possible that there will be a Motif-API complient toolkit with
  an OpenLook Look & Feel?

- How about an OLIT/XView/OI/Interviews API toolkit with a Motif L & F?
  (I know OI already does this, but will this be considered COSE-complient?)

- Will there be more than one "standard" toolkit API or L & F supported?

- How does using ToolTalk fit in with Motif?

This is my attempt to start a discussion in order to pull as much 
knowledge about these questions off the net... Feel free to e-mail
or followup.

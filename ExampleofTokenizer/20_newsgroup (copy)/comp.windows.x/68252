Many spreadsheets do regression analysis.  The topic is also well covered
in most undergraduate statistic books.  Cubic Splines are usually well
covered in any undergraduate computer science numerical analysis text.
I am sure ge/mm has a well stocked library.

I have never used mathematica, but I would be surprised if it could not do a 
spline.

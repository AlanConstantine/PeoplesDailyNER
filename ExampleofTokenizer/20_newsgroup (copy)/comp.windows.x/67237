Hi folks
Thanks to the ones that replied, however, my problem turned out
to be very simple.

In my .Xresources I had a space after XTerm*font:   10x20.
Removing this and xrdb fixed my problem.

Also, same symptom, was that some of my users did not have the
proper capitals for XTerm*font.

Thanks again

Bob

Hi folks,

I'm trying to compile xfig 2.1.7 on a SS1+ running SunOS 4.1.1 and OW 2.0,
and I'm having a little trouble with make/imake.  Specifically, make bombs
when it needs to use any Xaw file.  This isn't surprising since X11 files
on Suns with the standard OW 2.0 distribution are in various places under
/usr/openwin (Xaw files are in /usr/openwin/share/include/X11/Xaw !!)
Actually, the real problem is that I know squat about imake, and I don't
know how to tell imake where the X11 files are.  I can see from the 
Makefile that it's looking in the wrong places, but the first line of the 
Makefile reads 

   # Makefile generated by imake - do not edit!

Help!  Is there some way I can edit the Imakefile to tell it where to
look?  (I have set DEFINES = -DOPENWIN_BUG, as it said to in the README
file.)

Email and post are both fine.

Thanks in advance,

Dave

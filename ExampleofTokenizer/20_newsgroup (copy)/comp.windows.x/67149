#Do anyone know about any shading program based on Xlib in the public domain?
#I need an example about how to allocate correct colormaps for the program.
#
#Appreciate the help.

I don't know if this might help, but I've just started playing with a program
called POVRay (Persistance of Vision Raytracer) that also displays its output
via X Windows.  It does a fairly good job of allocating the colormap on my
Psuedo-Color 8-plane display.  I got the source from from a site in Canda.
The person I retrieved them from was David Buck (dbuck@ccs.carleton.ca).

Hi there

(I posted this to comp.windows.x.intrinsics but got no response, so I'm posting
here.)

I'm wanting to connect a digitiser made for PCs into my workstation (an HP 720).
It is my understanding the X windows can understand a variety of input devices
including digitiser tablets.  However, this digitiser makes use of the serial
port, so there would seem to be a need to have a special device driver.

The HP manual pages say that the HP X server will accept X input from
devices listed in the /usr/lib/X11/X*devices file (* = display number).
I shouldn't think I would be able to simply insert /dev/rs232c as an input
device in this file and expect a digitiser to work.  But maybe I'm wrong.  Am I?

What I would like to know is: does anybody out there have a digitiser connected
to their workstation for use as a pointer for X (rather than just as input to a
specific X application)?  If so, what were the steps required for installation?
Did you need a special device driver?  Did the manufacturer supply it?  Are
there generic public domain device drivers around?  (I understand that
digitisers generally use only a couple of standard formats.)

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Cheers
- Vaughan

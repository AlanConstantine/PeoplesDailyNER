Hi, netters:

We have a problem with 'makedepend': it doesn't know how to correctly process
#if clause in C preprocessor statements. It evaluates everything to
true no matter what the conditionals are.
For example, makedepend chokes on one of X11 include files (as distributed
by Sun) - namely Xos.h:

#if     !defined(SUNOS41) || defined(__STDC__)
#       include <string.h>
#       define  index   strchr
#       define  rindex  strrchr
#else   /* BSD && !__STDC__ */
#       include <strings.h>
#endif  /* !SUNOS41 || __STDC__ */

Here 'makedepend' evaluates both #if and corresponding #else statements
to 'true' and tries to open the file <strings.h> which doesn't exist
under Solaris2.
We also have a lot of #if statements in some of our legacy code.
We got and built 'makedepend' off the net - it didn't fix the problem.

In all fairness it should be noted that 'makdepend' man-page (Sun's
distribution) mentions this problem:

BUGS
     If you do not have  the  source  for  cpp,  the  Berkeley  C
     preprocessor, then makedepend will be compiled in such a way
     that all #if directives will evaluate to  "true"  regardless
     of  their  actual  value.  This may cause the wrong #include
     directives to be evaluated.  Makedepend should  simply  have
     its own parser written for #if expressions.

Has anybody come up with some solution/fix to 'makdepend' other than
WriteYourOwnParser... and willing to share it with us?

Since we often experience delays in our newsfeed - please reply 
directly to my e-mail address -> I'll post a summary.

Thanks in advance.

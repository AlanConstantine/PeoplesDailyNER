I am considering making a reasonably large application for free
distribution (probably copylefted).  I am going to use X.  Now I'm
bewildered by the huge number of "standards" that "open systems" has
created.  

I've lived in a fairly tookit-sheltered environment.  Most of the tools
here were produced with the Athena Widget set, or X Intrinsics or Xw
(??).  

In my humble opinion, they look like crap.  I don't know, however, if
this is a characteristic of the tookits, or just poor aestetic taste
in the programmers.

I would like my app to look a little more "sculptured" like mwm.  I
understand, however, that mwm isn't free like the other tookits.

I am getting Linux, so I will have InterViews, but I don't know how it
will look.  I get the impression Andrew is from the FSF, but I don't
know what it looks like either.

If you can help explain this toolkit mess to me, I would be much
obliged.  Which are free?  Which are the best?  Which are portable?  Which
looks nice?  Which is not a resource hog?

Also, if you happen to know which are available on Linux and/or Sun,
that would be a big help too.

Thanks in advance.

We're looking at various X11 clients for PC's and we're looking for some
information about the relative efficiency of different products.  Are any
notably efficient (fast)?  Are any notably inefficient?  I assume that a
Graphics Accelerator makes them significantly faster (right now I'm looking
at ico running on Xoftware/32 for Windows sitting on the Distinct TCP/IP
platform, and it's (not surprisingly) much slower than ico running on the
Sparc10's console.  What are the key ways of improving performance for
PC (presumably Windows) clients?

Also, what about async solutions?  (Yes, I appreciate that it will be 
*much* slower even with V.42bis.)  I'm in the process of installing PPP
(with header compression).  How does that compare to cslip?  I've seen
a product called XRemote by NCD that promises to be pretty efficient, but
are there comparable products out there?  If we're looking for efficiency
for async, PC clients, what should we be looking at in addition to standard
PPP w/ compression and XRemote?

Any information would be greatly appreciated.  I'm still taking in all
the information in the faq, but any tips about the relative efficiency
of various product offerings would be great.  (I get the impression
that discussions about speed are largely application specific, but
that not withstanding, any comments would be appreciated.)  Thanks.

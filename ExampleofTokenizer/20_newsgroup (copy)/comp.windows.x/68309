Why do many (?) people believe that Xhibition '93 is one of the "paid
market hype NT conferences" (as you put it)? I for one am going, because
I, too, am curious about the technology. I think this is a great chance
to learn about NT, mainly because:

  - It will be presented in X's "home turf". I believe that the attendees
    will mostly have X backgrounds (biases? :-); thus, I expect that the
    NT presentations will face a tough audience.

  - I can be there in person to judge for myself whether or not NT is what
    it is hyped to be. This is as closely as I can get to in evaluating the
    NT technology without actually using it myself, which I don't have the
    time to do.

  - If NT turns out to be a vapor technology and I get bored, there will be
    many other interesting tutorials/presentations that I won't have to
    waste my time ... in California?!?  :-)

Just my thoughts...

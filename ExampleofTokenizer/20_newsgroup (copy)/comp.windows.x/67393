i read about the code you can put in to most applications so that
the virtual desktop stuff in tvtwm doesn't confuse them (or is the
application confusing the virtual-ness? [chicken & the egg?]

but wanted to see if it has been applied to a version of xroach

i never could quite get ssetroot to work either? any suggestions.
luckily xv -root -quit does the trick for the most part

also, i'ld be quite interested in hearing more about the icon region
for each virtual window under tvtwm that i read a thread on last week
here
	thanx,

Hi all,

I've read the FAQ, I've fiddled around, but I am still having problems getting
my poor old HP9000/300 to let me input/display characters above 127.  I have 
the following in my .Xdefaults:

XTerm*Font     :   -adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--14-140-75-75-m-90-iso8859-1

So I believe that I have the correct font selected to use in xterm.  I have NOT
set my LC_CTYPE environment variable because whatever I put it, it tells me that
that locale is not supported (apparently we have no additional locales defined,
or at least, /lib/locale doesn't exist).  I can get some of the characters
above 127 to print out, but they are not where I'd expect them -- for example,
Alt-v does not produce a u umlaut.  This leads me to believe that the fault
lies with the stty settings, which are as follows:

speed 9600 baud; line = 0; susp <undef>; dsusp <undef>
intr = ^C; quit = ^\; erase = ^H; kill = ^K; swtch = ^@
eof = ^D; eol = ^@; min = 4; time = 0; stop = ^S; start = ^Q
-parenb -parodd cs8 -cstopb hupcl cread -clocal -loblk -crts 
-ignbrk -brkint -ignpar -parmrk -inpck -istrip -inlcr -igncr icrnl -iuclc 
ixon -ixany ixoff -ienqak 
isig icanon iexten -xcase echo echoe echok -echonl -noflsh 
opost -olcuc onlcr -ocrnl -onocr -onlret -ofill -ofdel -tostop 

Anyway, I've struggled with this off and on for a couple of weeks, and any help
anyone could offer would be greatly appreciated.


					Thanks!

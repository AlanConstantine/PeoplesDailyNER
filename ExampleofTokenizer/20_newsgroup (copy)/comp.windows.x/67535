	Three q's:

1) is it reliable?

2) how does it send the information from a MS Windows app over
the X11 protocol? Does it just draw everything as graphics into
one window, or does it use multiple windows and essentially work
more cleverly?

3) If I want to run MS Word, for example, remotely, do I have to
run a separate copy of MS Windows remotely, and then start MS
Word from that, or can MS Word be started remotely on its own?

	Thanks a lot!

Version 1.0 of NCSA Mosaic for the X Window System, a networked
information systems and World Wide Web browser, is hereby released:

file://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Mosaic/xmosaic-source/xmosaic-1.0.tar.Z
                            .../xmosaic-binaries/xmosaic-sun.Z
                            .../xmosaic-binaries/xmosaic-sgi.Z
                            .../xmosaic-binaries/xmosaic-ibm.Z
                            .../xmosaic-binaries/xmosaic-dec.Z
                            .../xmosaic-binaries/xmosaic-alpha.Z
                            .../xmosaic-diffs/xmosaic-0.13-1.0-diffs.Z

NCSA Mosaic provides a consistent and easy-to-use hypermedia-based
interface into a wide variety of networked information sources,
including Gopher, WAIS, World Wide Web, NNTP/Usenet news, Techinfo,
FTP, local filesystems, Archie, finger, Hyper-G, HyTelnet, TeXinfo,
telnet, tn3270, and more.

This release of NCSA Mosaic is known to compile on the following
platforms:

  SGI (IRIX 4.0.2) 
  IBM (AIX 3.2)
  Sun 4 (SunOS 4.1.3 with stock X11R4 and Motif 1.1, and GCC).
  DEC Ultrix.
  DEC Alpha AXP (OSF/1).

Documentation is available online.

Changes since 0.13 include:

 o Added new resource, gethostbynameIsEvil, for Sun's that
   coredump when gethostbyname() is called to try to find out what
   their own names are. (Command-line flag is -ghbnie.) 
 o Explicitly pop down all dialog boxes when document view
   window is closed, for window managers too dull to do so
   themselves. 
 o Better visited anchor color for non-SGI's. 
 o Added .hqx and .uu to list of file extensions handled like .tar files. 
 o Added 'Clear' button to Open box, to allow more convenient
   cut-n-paste entries of URL's. 
 o New resource 'autoPlaceWindows'; if set to False, new document
   view windows will not be automatically positioned by the
   program itself (but it's still up to your window manager just how
   they're placed). 
 o Command-line flags -i and -iconic now have desired effect (new
   resource initialWindowIconic can also be used). 
 o Gif-reading code is a little more bulletproof. 
 o Obscure infinite loop triggered by extra space in IMG tag fixed. 
 o Eliminated nonintuitive error message when image can't be read
   (inlined NCSA bitmap is indication enough that something's not
   right for authors, and readers can't do anything about bad images
   in any case). 
 o Obscure parsing bug (for constructs like <ADDRESS><A
   HREF=...>text<A></ADDRESS>) fixed. 
 o Fixed mysterious stupid coredump that only hits Suns. 
 o Fixed stupid coredump on URL's like '://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/'. 
 o Fixed buglet in handling rlogin URL's. 
 o New support for Solaris/SYSVR4 (courtesy
   dana@thumper.bellcore.com). 
 o Better support for HP-UX 8.x and 9.x (courtesy
   johns@hpwarf.wal.hp.com). 
 o Better support for NeXT (courtesy scott@shrug.dur.ac.uk). 
 o Some miscellaneous portability fixes (courtesy
   bingle@cs.purdue.edu). 
 o Miscellaneous bug fixes and cleanups. 

Comments, questions, and bug reports should be sent to
mosaic-x@ncsa.uiuc.edu.  Thanks in advance for any feedback you can
provide.

Cheers,
Marc

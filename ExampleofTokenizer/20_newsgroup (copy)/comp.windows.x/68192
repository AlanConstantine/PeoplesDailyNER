Hi.

I'm wonderring if it is possible to replace a single module, as XKeybind.o
in a shared library, as libX11.so in Suns OpenWindows. I tried to RTFM, but
I didn't get any wiser that way. Also, can I do the same on an RS6000 machine
running 3.2.2 (if it is possible at all). I know how to do it with real 
libraries (ar). I am trying to replace XLookupString in the delivered
libraries, with another that does a few special things.

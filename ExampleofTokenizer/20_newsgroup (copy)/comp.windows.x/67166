I just implemented this and it seems I can just about achieve the display
rates (20 400x400x8 frames / sec on IPX) that I get with Sunview, though
it's a bit "choppy" at times. Also, loading the data, making an XImage,
then XPut'ing it into a pixmap is a bit cumbersome, so the animation is
slower to load than with Sunview. Is there a better way to load in the
data?

Shared memory PutImage (also mentioned by nkissebe@delphi.beckman.uiuc.edu,
Nick Kisseberth) looks interesting, but I need someone to point me to some
documentation. Is this method likely to give better results than server-
resident pixmaps? I'd also be interested in looking at the XView code
mentioned above...

Thanks for the help so far. If I get something decent put together, I'll
definitely post it to the Net.

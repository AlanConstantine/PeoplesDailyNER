Hi there netters,

I require a window to appear at a co-ordinates (0,0) (top left corner) of my
screen (root window). Could some windows guru out there help me on how to
go about doing this. I write the whole program which creates the window with
the image it displays - I require the image to appear at the top-left corner
so that I can grab it for recording on to video, using a MIniVas controller,
which expects the window at the same spot every time.

Thanks in advance.

sincerely,

Sanjeev Sharma

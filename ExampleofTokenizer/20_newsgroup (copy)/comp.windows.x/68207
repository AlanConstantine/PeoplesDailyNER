When I changed from SVR4 to SVR4.2 on my Intel box I discovered that
some of my SVR4 xclients such as xload, etc would no longer work.


They bomb out with the message:

error: can't open display unix:0.0

Is this because they can't find the correct shared libraries, they need
to be recompiled, or have I not used the correct options?

Both systems use X11R5.

Thanks.

Jack.

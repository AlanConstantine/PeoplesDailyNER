Is there aything available for X similar to QuicKeys for the Macintosh --
something that will allow me to store and playback sequences of keystrokes,
menu selections, and mouse actions - directing them towards another
application?

If so, could someone send me information on its availability -- and if not,
how hard do we think it might be to send input to other X applications and,
hopefully, deal with their responses appropriately?  (If an application is
going to take a few seconds to process I probably have to wait  for it to
complete before sending another command.)

thanks,

david,

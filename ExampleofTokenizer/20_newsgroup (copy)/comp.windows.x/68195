Thanks to everyone who mailed help, unfortunately the end problem was a REALLY
stupid `oversight' on my behalf. The code was 100% perfect, but it might
help to add Control.C to my makefile.......

	Anyway the mangled name was telling me it could'nt locate the Control
constructor...

	I just want to reaffirm what a valuable book this one is, I'm enjoying
evry page :)

I am having the problem of ensuring point-to-focus when the mouse
cursor enters a window in my application.  I'm using InterViews,
but that may not matter, this seems to be a generic problem in X.
For example, I use OpenWindows on a Sparc2, with point-to-focus
set, and that generally works, but not always, depending on what
was going on in some window when I move the cursor from one shell
tool window to another.  Or so it seems...

My question, then, is what can I do within X to guarantee point-to-
focus within my application?  Thanks for any response.

Dave

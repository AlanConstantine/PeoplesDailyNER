The following packages meet your criteria in that they are PD and
present an aesthetically pleasant graphical interface to the users.

If you can use 386bsd:
	there is xview3 (OpenLook)

	there is Interviews which looks a little like Motif

	there is gopath a very nice C++ toolkit for Athena Widgets and Motif
	         which is simpler
                 and better than interviews and you will enjoy
                 technical support from Bull via e-mail
		 It has a nice draw program (it uses motif) which can be used
		 to create graphical front-end to programs.
		 The data format is called streams which you can feed
		 to your programs. I ported gopath on an internet machine
		 which is gone but if you use gcc-2.3.3 with minimal effort
		 gopath can be ported to 386bsd.
		 Last but not least, gopath interfaces to toolkits via a driver
		 module. They have an MS-Windows driver module for instance.

	Also, many have written extensions to tk/tcl thus allowing powerful
	applications. For instance, tcl_nm  has snmp extensions for tk/tcl.
	With ease, I  can now combine snmp network operations with graphs,
	photo-widget, graphical interface, file operations, database 
	operations,etc.. The author of tcl_nm mail me a simple network 
	management application which was about 80 lines long - it displayed
	various environmental parameters from a router. I wrote  a simple
	strip chart script for displaying Real-Time ip received
	packets/seconds.


	Hope this helps,
	Amancio Hasty

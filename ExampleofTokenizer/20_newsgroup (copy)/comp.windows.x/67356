I don't know if there's a corresponding patch for Solaris 2.1, but this
sounds like the following bug which is supposedly fixed in 100492-06, the
Solaris 1.x olwm Jumbo patch:

	1108642 - window system can hang in an errant pointer grab

Actually, I suspect that the OW 3.1 problem may be different, since the
README file says that this patch is just a SunOS 4.x version of the OW 3.1
olwm (but maybe that line came from an earlier version of the patch, and
they forgot to take it out in the -06 version).

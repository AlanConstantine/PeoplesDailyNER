Subject: VXT2000 Windowing Terminal Help

Greetings!


We have several VXT 2000 Windowing terminals and associated software on our
network.  We are able to open a LAT terminal window to any of our workstation
nodes but we are unable to get a LAT X session to work.

We have customized the terminal security to allow all LAT connections.

Trying to invoke a LAT X session from the VXT 2000 results in the following
message being displayed in the terminal manager window message area:

Host Does Not Support X Sessions

(The host is a VAX4000 Model 60 and does support X sessions)


Opening a LAT terminal window and logging into the server node, setting the
display variable as follows:

$ set display/create/node=LAT_###########/transport=lat

and then trying to create a decterm on the VXT as follows:

$ create/term=decterm/detach

Fails and gives the following error message:

dectermport failed to find language, XOpenDisplay("")  returned NULL
%DECW-F-CANT-OPEN-DISPL Can't open display

The VXT 2000 is using its system defaults (ie. default font(s), language, ...)
except for the security options to allow all connections and options enabling 
LAT protocol.

we have VT1200 windowing terminals and the above things were enough to allow
LAT X sessions.

VMS Version is 5.5-1
Running DECwindows/Motif of VAX4000 Model 60s


Please help.

I am wondering how to change the English fonts in an existed 
API to some multi-bytes fonts ? (such as Chinese, Japanese...)
Someone told me X11R5 supports some internationalization
features, but I cannot find any examples for my need. Is there
anybody has done some similar jobs ?

By the way, all the English fonts should be replace by Chinese or
Japanese fonts, that means in windows, menubar, button....

That will be great if someone can share us what you have done.
Thanks in advance.

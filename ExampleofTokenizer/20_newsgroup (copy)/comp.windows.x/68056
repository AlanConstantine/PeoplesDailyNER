I am planning to convert my Motif 1.2 app from pixel to font units
which would all be set in the app's resource file instead of hard coded
in the program.

However, the word here is from people who tried this already that for
some unknown reason XmForm offsets placed in the resource file are still
interpreted in pixel units forcing people to code those offset font units into the program.

Can somebody confirm this?

Thanks,
Joe Pannon

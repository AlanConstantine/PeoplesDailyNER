Well I can buy a bigger and more powerful server machine because of the 
significant drop in price year after year.  The link I want to use 
though (ISDN 64K) is costly and the bandwidth limited.  That's why my
interest lies in seeing if such a link can be used and see what traffic 
goes through it.

Hmmm.  Has anyone at your centre monitored the traffic at all?  Are you
running any standard MS-Windows programs like Word ?  What sort of 
packets go blazing through? What size link do you have (2Mb or 10Mb ?).
What is the average traffic flow going through your network or do you
have few high peaks and then many low points?

What do you mean by network things?  I vision using MS Windows and other
Windows applications over the network were the processes are running on
the server and all I am getting are the displays.  I am wondering how 
good is the X and subsequently DV/X protocol in transferring these 
images with X-calls and displaying them on a client's machine.

Hello,

This is my first net letter, so forgive mistakes!

I have been plagued by problems (or lack of info) with
authorization in Open Windows 3.0 for a long while and
would like some help please!  I generally use strait
MIT X, and so don't use OW much, but when I share 
X software with others - bad news.

PROBLEM:

My friend who logs into his SSII trys to run my 
program that runs fine on my machine, however, 
my friend gets "client not authorized to connect 
to server" (or something close).  If OW is started
with the -noauth option all is well, but surely this
is not required in general!

Also, xhost + does not work, becoming root does not 
work, etc... 

Any help will be greatly appreciated!

Thanx

Hear! Hear! I agree completely. One thing I can't stand about
the Mac interface is its shear determination to FORCE you to use
the mouse(what if your mouse breaks--your whole system is
down!).  I like the mouse--it is handy on some occassions such
as cut and past and moving icons around, etc.  But for most
work, the keyboard and hot keys are 10-20 times faster than
using the mouse. Sure it is a plus to be able to do something
simple if you are an inexperienced user, but how long is it
before your are experienced? A month? Two? (Speaking of PCs at
the moment.)
	I don't think it is too much to ask that window
programmers provide not only a menu/mouse interface but also
look forward to those who would like to move on to hot keys and
command line interfaces, which usually allows you to do more in
less time IF you are experienced.
	All of the above equally applies to windowing systems on
UNIX (especially since Unix is at least 500% more powerful than
DOS).

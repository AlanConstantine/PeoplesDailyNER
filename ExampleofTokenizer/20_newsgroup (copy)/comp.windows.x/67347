[Please accept the following announcement for comp.windows.x.announce. -gf]

A completely revamped version of the X11 browser interface to Archie,
Xarchie, is now available as
	export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/xarchie-2.0.tar.Z

For those not familar with Archie or Xarchie, I include part of the
manpage intro:

  Xarchie is an X11 browser interface to the Archie Internet information
  system using the Prospero virtual filesystem protocol.  Archie
  provides information about files available for ftp anywhere on the
  Internet; Xarchie displays this information using an easy-to-use,
  point-and-click interface.  Xarchie allows you to further explore ftp
  sites by examining directories returned as query matches, and allows
  you to retrieve files located this way.

Xarchie 2.0 has been extensively tested on R4, R5, and a variety of
other flavors of X, and on a wide range of machines. A summary of the
new features (from the README) follows:

  * Major improvements include:
    - Multiple selections allowed in browser for use with other new
      features (FWF MultiList widget).
    - Ability to expand directories in browser.
    - Real fully-integrated ftp implementation.
    - Ability to save and reload query results, as well as print them.
    - Ability to resort results, and sort results by user-definable
      pseudo-weights.
    - Online help browser.
    - Color resources, done so that they don't break mono displays.
    - FWF FileSelector widget for local file operations.
    - Makefile.dst's supplied for the imake-impaired.

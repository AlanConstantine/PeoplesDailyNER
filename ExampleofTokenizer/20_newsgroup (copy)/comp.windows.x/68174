I have tried that with one font, if your xterm terminfos/termcaps are set up
to NOT remap bold (which they are be default) to reverse, then nothing happens
when bold is displayed.  It would appear (at least in X11R4) than you cannot
display bold in an xterm without specifying two fonts; a normal and a bold.
I wish someone would prove that incorrect.

I checked the FAQ on this first, and no luck..


I need to convert the R5 Tree widget for use with xview v3.0. The
problem is the fact that xview uses their own event loop system, and I
was wondering if anyone had any tips (or converted source) on converting
these pups.


Thanks,
    Sean. (wipeout+@cmu.edu)

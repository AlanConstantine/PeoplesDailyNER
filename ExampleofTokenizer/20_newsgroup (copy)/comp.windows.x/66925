The following problem is really bugging me,
and I would appreciate any help.

I create two windows:

w1 (child to root) with event_mask = ButtonPressMask|KeyPressMask;
w2 (child to w1) with do_not_propagate_mask = ButtonPressMask|KeyPressMask;


Keypress events in w2 are discarded, but ButtonPress events fall through
to w1, with subwindow set to w2.

FYI, I'm using xnews/olvwm.

Am I doing something fundamentally wrong here?

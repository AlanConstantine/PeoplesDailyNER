I have looked through the FAQ sections and have not
seen a answer for this.

I have an X/Motif application that I have written.
I have a couple of gif files (or pict) that I have
scanned in with a color scanner.  Now I would like
to be able to convert the gif files into a format
that could be read into my application and displayed
on the background of its main window. Preferably with
pixmaps, or perhaps as an XImage.

I have found functions in the pbmplus program suite
to convert gif to xbm, but that is monochrome, and
I really do need color.

I have looked at xv, which reads in gif, and writes
out several formats, but have not found a way to write
out a file which can be read in as a pixmap.

Is there an easy way to do this?

email responses preferred.

thanks!

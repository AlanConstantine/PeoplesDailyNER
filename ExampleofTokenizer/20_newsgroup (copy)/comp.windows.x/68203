Hmm, depends on how you define 'clean'. Jordan implemented the system
dependent stuff in a way that you have basic implementations for,
call it, operating system types, then you go ahead and write a include
file for your specific machine or operating system using the basic
implementations. Since both Jordan and I haven't encountered a 
OS flavor yet, that is fully POSIX, we haven't gotten around to
really implement (and test) a top-level include file specifically
for just posix. The posix routines are used in the sun specific file
tty_sun.i for example, but here we also use some bsd stuff. All in all
it still is probably better to implement a include file for each and
every operating system than '#ifdef'ing in existing ones. The type
of mess that can result from that can clearly be seen in the xterm
sources. Even if quite a bit of code gets copied almost unchanged a 
couple of times, this only uses up some disk space, since only the 
"drivers" actually included from the toplevel include file will be 
compiled into emu.

It shouldn't be hard to come up with a tty_linux.i file that fully
relies on the posix stuff, but unfortunately I don't have a linux
system available to me, so I can't do the port myself. I would suggest
you read the README in term/sysdep and if you have any problems or
questions, contact me and we could try to sort this out. Unfortunately
we have to rely on help from the net on this part of emu, since we 
just don't have access to that many different systems.

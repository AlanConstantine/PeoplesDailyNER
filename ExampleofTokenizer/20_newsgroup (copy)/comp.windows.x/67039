   Environment:
      mach/arch : sparc/sun4  (IPX)
      OS	: SunOS 4.1.3
      X11	: X11R5 (patchlevel 22)
      Motif	: 1.2.2

I bring up X server using 'startx' and /usr/bin/X11/Xsun. The following sequence
of actions crashes the X server (SIGPIPE, errno=32, 'xinit' reports that connexion 
to X server lost):

   1. xinit -- Xsun
   2. start mwm
   3. start a client with a 100dpi/75dpi font.
   4. move the window by dragging the title bar.

The server dumps core due to SIGPIPE. One of the two messages is printed:

  "Connection to X server lost"

or
  
  "Connection broken (errno=32)"

(I believe the first is reported by a client and the second by the server itself).

Next, I ran xdm in debug level = 5. After the same set of actions, xdm reports:

  select returns -1
  Server for :0 terminated unexpectedly: status 2560


Note:
 * The problem doesn't occur with other window managers (twm or olwm). 
 * I have not set LD_LIBRARY_PATH. 
 * I am not running font server. 
 * If I start the client with fixed width font, I do not see this problem.
 * My font path:
     /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/,/usr/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo/,/usr/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/,/usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi

   (I did mkfontdir in /usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi, /usr/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi,
   /usr/lib/X11/fonts/PEX, /usr/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo,
   and in /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc).

 * This problem seems to occur only on IPX machines. I do not see this 
   problem on IPC workstations.

Questions:
 * What the hell is goin on ? :-)
 * What does "status 2560" mean (of the server).

I'd greatly appreciate any hints as to the cause of the problem.

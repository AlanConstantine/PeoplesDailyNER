Okay, I looked through the FAQs and didn't see this, but I know its
come up before...

XAllocColor is supposed to do the following in order:
    Try to find an exact match read-only color cell. (within hardware limits)
    Try to allocate a read-only colorcell and set it to match.
	and when all else fails, 
    Return the colorcell with the best match from the read-only colors 
    already allocated in the colormap.

This sounds good in theory.  It doesn't seem to work this way
though.  If there is no exact match already in the colormap, and 
no unallocated cells, then XAllocColor fails, even when it has 
already allocated several other cells already, and there are dozens 
of read-only cells already in the colormap.

Is this a bug?  A feature?  A misunderstanding on my part?

Any help appreciated,

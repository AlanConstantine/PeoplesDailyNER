What are HyperHelp and Xprinter?  Read on......
---------------------------------------------------------
Bristol Technology is proud to announce version 3.0 of
its popular HyperHelp product and version 2.0 of Xprinter.

			    HyperHelp 3.0
			    -------------
HyperHelp is the de-facto standard for on-line context
sensitive help in the Unix marketplace.  Through a one
line function call, application developers can access the
full features of HyperHelp and cut down drastically on
their development time.  HyperHelp can use the same RTF,
project, and bitmap files as the MS Windows Help facility.
This allows a documentation department to maintain a single
set of help documents portable between MS Windows, Motif and
Open Look.  HyperHelp can also be authored in FrameMaker. 
And with HyperHelp 3.0 Bristol introduces its SGML compiler!

New features in HyperHelp 3.0 include secondary windows,a character
based viewer, segmented bitmaps, SGML support, and an improved History
window.

			     Xprinter 2.0
			     ------------
Xprinter 2.0 allows developers to add sophisticated
printer support to their existing/new X based applications
very easily.  Xprinter uses the Xlib API for both the
display and printer.  This lets you use the exact same code
for drawing and printing.  Take a look at the source code for
our demo and see Xprinter in action.

If you are interested in adding PostScript and PCL5 support
to your application, Xprinter is the tool for you!  Earlier
this year Bristola dn USL signed an agreement that
resulted in Xprinter becoming the standard printing technology
for UNIX SVR4.2.


Feel free to run the demo and let us know what you think about
HyperHelp and Xprinter.

				Happy demoing,

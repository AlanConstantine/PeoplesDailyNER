Hi,

I just got XFree86 running on my pc with Consensys and encountered a few
minor (I hope) probems.

The pc is hooked up to a LAN where I want remote X applications to 
connect to my X-server.  I believe the command to permit this is
xhost.  When I'm logged on my pc and type 'xhost + '  ,  I get the error message saying
"You must be on local machine to enable access". 
what does this mean ?  ain't I already on the local machine?

Another problem I have is with the mouse movement.  I find that the 
mouse cursor moves extremely slow and choppy.
How can I make the mouse cursor move more accurately?


thank in advance.
Any help is much appreciated.

please send replies to christy@alex.qc.ca.


Christy

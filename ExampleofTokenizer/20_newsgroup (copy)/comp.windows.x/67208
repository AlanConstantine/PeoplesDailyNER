I have the March/April version of the X Journal open in front of me.

I'll be working on programming x-clients this summer, and since I don't have
much experience with programming X, I thought this issue might be helpful
as it has a section on debugging, and a section on the 40 most common errors
in programming X.

At the end of the errors section, there are the following references for
tutorials on X programming style.  They are:

Rosenthal, David -   A simple X11 client program
  Proceedings of the Winter 1988 Usenix Conference, 1988.

Lemke, D., and Rosenthal, D. -  Visualizing X11 clients
  Proceedings of the Winter 1989 Usenix Conference, 1989.


Does anyone know where I could find these in printed or (preferably)
electronic form?

Or can you suggest any net resources devoted to the introduction to
programming X (I'll be looking at the bookstore for books, so I am really
only asking about what I can find on the net.)

Thanks,

David Simpson

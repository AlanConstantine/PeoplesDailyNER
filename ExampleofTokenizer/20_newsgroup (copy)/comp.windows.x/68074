Hi!

	I have a question which is not directly related to X Screen Saver.

What X Screen Saver does is to blank the screen if it has been idle for
some time.  I don't want my screen to go blank but to get locked or call
xlock program.

	Is there a parallel call to XSetScreenSaver() which locks my screen
or call my lock program after certain amount of idle time?  Or is there a
way to find out how long the server has been idle?

Thanks

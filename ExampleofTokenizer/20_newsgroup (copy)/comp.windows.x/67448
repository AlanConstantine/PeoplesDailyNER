Subject: XmTextField truncation with LANG bug(???)

I have found a situation which I think is a bug in X or Motif, but I'm hoping
is really just a mistake on my part.  Does anyone know anything about
this problem........

- I am using an XmTextField, and setting its XmNvalue to a hardcoded
  text string (ascii or Kanji) either via XtSetValues or XmTextSetString.
  The problem is that when the XmTextField is displayed, the text is getting
  truncated, depending on the setting of the environment variables
  LANG (more specifically LC_ALL).  When they are set to japanese,
  the text gets truncated.  When they are set to english, everything
  works fine.  I am taking the default for XmNcolumns.
  (Please note that hardcoding of text is NOT done in my actual
   application, just in my sample code to make things easier)
	
- I am running Motif 1.2, X11R5 via HPUX9.01.  My test program is set up
  to handle 16 bit Kanji characters.  I have remembered to do   
  XtSetLanguageProc() prior to my MrmInitialize and my font resources
  are set to japanese fonts.

- Don't know if this matters, but my dialog box and TextField is initially
  created with UIL. 


The problem does NOT happen with XmText.  Unfortunately substituting
XmTextFields with XmTexts in my application is not an acceptable
alternative (way too much code to be modified while in beta!)

I have a small test program which illustrates the problem if anyone
wants it.  My best guess is that either the X code or Motif is not
properly allocating memory for japanese, but since I don't have the
source to look at it is just a guess.

Please let me know if this sounds familiar, or if you have a suggestion,
or if you want the sample program.

THANKS!!!!!!!!

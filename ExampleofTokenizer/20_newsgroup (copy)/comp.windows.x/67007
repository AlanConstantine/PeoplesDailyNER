It seems like XTranslateCoord. doesn't work the way I expecting it.  Right
after performs a XMoveWindow, I want to know the absolute window position
with respect to the root window.  To get this info. I do a XTranslateCoordinates
but the abs_x, and abs_y aren't right?  Does anybody know of a way to find 
out this information?

Thanks, please e-mail to hsteve@carina.unm.edu if it's possible

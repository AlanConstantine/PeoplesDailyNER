We are planning on buying 15-20 X Terminals.  I have the article from Jim
Morton regarding prices, etc., and am looking for any other information
that will help me decide which to buy.

The terminals will be connected to a DEC 3000/400 AXP with 96Mb RAM,
running OSF/1.  From what I have found out so far, it would be best to run
as much as possible in the terminal itself (X11, window manager, xterm,
etc.), and that in order to do this we need n Mb RAM in the Xterminal
(where n ranges from 4 to 10, depending on who I talk to).

What should I be looking for?  What sort of questions should I be asking
the salespeople?

Thanks

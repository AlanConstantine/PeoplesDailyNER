Subject: Sun3/60 + X11R5 -> undeletable console messages.

We have an old Sun3/60 here which gets occasional use.  When X11R5 is started
on it any console messages during startup are undeletable.  After X is fully
started we run an xterm as the "console" - the problem is that any messages
that arrive before this starts go to the plain console.  "Refresh window" fails
to remove them.  The messages are a real pain since they sit in the middle of
the screen obscuring anything else below them.

At boot time the 3/60 lists two framebuffers  -  /dev/cgfour0 and /dev/bwtwo1.
We're running X in color, and I suspect that maybe the offending messages are
on the B/W framebuffer, and thereby not getting deleted.

My question is: has anyone else seen this, and is there an easy way to get rid
of these messages?

Please reply by e-mail to hughm@inmos.co.uk.

(BTW: SunOS 4.0.3, X11R5, mwm).

PS: I know I can redirect output of the relevant commands to /dev/null - I'm
    looking for a more general solution).

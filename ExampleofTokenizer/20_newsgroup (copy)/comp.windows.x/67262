Not being an Xt programmer by any stretch of the imagination, this is
driving me crazy and it's probably really simple to do.

I need to make a composite widget that does nothing at all but is
merely a placeholder in a widget instance heirarchy -- allowing me an
additional resource name level.

To illustrate I have an application with the following widget
heirarchy:

	    Shell Widget
	         |
	Application Widghet

I want the following:

	    Shell Widget
	         |
	Intermediate Widget
	         |
	 Application Widget

where the intermediate widget has a name but gets all its other
properties (and propagates down new values) from the shell widget.

I assume there's a simple way to do this but I can't find an example
and the documentation I have is rather vague about implementing
composite widgets.

Please respond via email.  Any help will be very much appreciated.

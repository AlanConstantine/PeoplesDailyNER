Now available: xvertext 5.0 
---------------------------

Another day, another xvertext release...

Summary                                  
-------
xvertext provides you with several functions to draw strings at any angle in   
an X window (previous versions were limited to vertical text). 

What's new since 4.0?
---------------------
o Existing bitmap fonts can be magnified to give reasonable fonts at large
  sizes.
o Bounding boxes can be obtained.
o The GC's stipple bitmap is honoured.
o Font IDs can be cached when font names are unavailable.
o An Imakefile is present.
o The demos are better (including a ransom note like the 
  comp.sources.postscript one)

Where can I get it? 
-------------------
comp.sources.x (soon...)
export.lcs.mit.edu : contrib/xvertext.5.0.shar.Z  (now)

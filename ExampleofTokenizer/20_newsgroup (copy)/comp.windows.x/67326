The Andrew User Interface System is supported, maintained, enhanced, and
distributed by the Andrew Consortium, Carnegie Mellon.  The distribution
terms are those of the X consortium, not the GNU Public License.  Thus
anyone can commercially exploit the Andrew code without restriction. 
(To encourage membership, however, we defer universal release of the
latest versions until Consortium members have had an opportunity to
explore the new capabilities.)

To se what AUIS looks like, you can try a remote demo.  You need an X
server (R5 is best) on a machine linked to the internet.  Give the
command 

	finger help@atk.itc.cmu.edu 

for instructions.

NOTE:  The demo version does not use the Motif-look-and-feel scrollbar,
but one is available.  You can use it on the demo by changing an option
in the ~/preferences file and starting a new editor.

The Andrew Toolkit component of AUIS is ideal if you want to build
applications using compound documents.  Andrew's major feature is its
architecture for recursive embedding of objects: equation in table in
figure in text, for example.  This architecture extends to areas not
usually found in toolkits, including file stream formats, cut/paste, and
printing.

Andrew also provides some of the most commonly requested applications: 
word processor, spreadsheet, drawing editor, and font editor (the latter
two are in version 5.2 which will be generally released on the XR6 tape
in December.)

I have two questions (well probably more...) about how Expose & Configure
events are handled.

I have an appl. which uses 1 window to draw in.  Since I give the user the
capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be
resized, I made a translation table for the Expose & Configure events.
The Expose event calls my redraw method while the Configure event
calls my rescale method.  The rescale method invokes a "fake" Expose
event (actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate Expose struct)
to draw the data.

Quest 1.
When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R4 (running in either R4 or R5 env.)
I get multiple (>4) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size
is changed.  I assume I'm getting cascading events.  Is that right?
Any suggestions as to how to handle/trap events in a better way?

Quest 2.
When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R5 I get no Expose events
whatsoever.  Do events and/or translation tables act differently in R5?

Thanks in advance

Steve

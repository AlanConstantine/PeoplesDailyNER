I find this thread on motif accelerators absoultly amazing.  If I were
writing an interface to keyboard accelerators, I would have one
resource called "accelerators" that took a translation table, period.
I would also implement it so that programmer never has to do any work
to get the accelerators installed.  As soon as the end-user specified
one, it would be active and automatically installed.

To get multiple accelerators on a single menu item I'd do something like:

	*menuItem.accelerators: #override \n\
		Ctrl<Key>M:	fire() \n\
		Shift<Key>L:	fire() \n

The accelerators would work exactly like translations and you would
automatically see a "Ctrl M" show up in your menuItem object.

Why in the world is the motif stuff so complicated with so many different
special cases depending on what type of widget you're dealing with?  There
has to be some reason.

Sorry for the political tone of this message...

I am trying to build and use imake (X11R4) on an IBM RS/6000 running AIX V3.2.
I am having the following 2 problems.

(1) Many of my Imakefile's have contructs like
                /**/#This is a makefile
        at the start of lines to pass Makefile comments thru the C
        preprocessor and into the Makefile.  Most of the C preprocessors that
        I have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the
        line.  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the
        start of a directive. 

        However the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol
        as the start of a directive.  The cpp fails when it determines
        that "This" is not a known directive.  I have temporarily hacked my
        imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better
        fix.

(2) Several Imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular
        use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter.  The AIX cpp
        gives warnings about these situations but continues to work OK.

If you are familiar with these problems and have solutions, I would appreciate
information about on your solutions.  (Perhaps, this is solved in a later
version of imake that I have not reviewed.)  Also, do you know of other cpp's
that behave similarly?

Since I do not have easy access to News, a response to
'white_billy@po.gis.prc.com' would be appreciated.

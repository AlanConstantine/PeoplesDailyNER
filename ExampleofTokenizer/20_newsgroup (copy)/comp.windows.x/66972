Or read fixes 9, 10, and 11 to the MIT distribution.  This is a known 
problem - just apply those fixes and set SunPost411FCSLd to YES and 
OSTeenyVersion in mit/config/sun.cf to 3.

In fix-09:
|If you are running SunOS 4.1.1 and you apply Sun's ld patch 100170-6,
|then you will need to edit your site.def and add this line to the
|AfterVendorCF section:
|
|#define SunPost411FCSLd   YES

In fix-10:
|If you are running SunOS 4.1.2, change OSTeenyVersion in mit/config/sun.cf to
|have a value of 2.

In fix-11:
|Brief notes on what this patch fixes:
|
|config: make on SunOS 4.1.2 fails unless tree previously built in

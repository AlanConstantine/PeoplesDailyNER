Subject: How to make a window's input be ALL CAPS without Caps Lock?

An application we *must* use requires upper-case input.  I'd like to be
able to simply move my cursor into the window where that application is running
(just a text window, xterm or some such) and have everything I type be entered
as ALL CAPS.  When the cursor is in any of my many other windows, I want to
automatically return to normal functionality.  I have point-to-type set.

Is there a way to do this in X (specifically OW 3.0 on SPARCs)?  Is there a
way to mess with .Xdefaults to make a category of window do this?  Any
hints would be most appreciated.  I program in C but not X, although I can
pick up somthing that's not too involved.

Thanks kindly.

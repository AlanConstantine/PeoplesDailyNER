Will someone who can 'see' the X-Face included in this header please reply
and tell me if it turned out okay?

I'm not all too sure about my viewing software.  I *hand*-converted this
thing in "vi" from a Sun rasterfile... what a pain!

For folks who haven't the slightest, it went like this:

-------------------------------------------------------------

		How to Make Your Own X-Face:
		   in 0x000F Easy Steps!

	1. Scan my Drivers' License into a *.PCX file.
	2. Use WinGIF to 'trim' my face out of the license,
		'reduce' it by half, and
		convert it to *.BMP.
	3. Use Paintbrush to touch up manually.
	4. Use WinGIF to 'reduce' it by half again.
	5. Use Paintbrush to touch up again.
	6. Use WinGIF to 'reduce' it by half *again*
		and convert it to *.GIF.

		[now over to the UNIX side...]

	7. Use Snapshot to convert the *.GIF to a Sun rasterfile.
	8. Use IconEdit to touch it up and
		convert it to an X bitmap.
	9. Use "vi" (yes, a *text* editor) to manually convert
		the rasterfile into the "Uncompressed X-Face" format.
		(Lots of global "ed" commands, and by the time you're
		 done you'll mirror hex bytewise in your sleep!!)

		[now over to the *Linux* side...]

	A. Use "compface" to convert it to what you see here:

 %:A<m@Dob}BO"'E",EEQGbn7qy(En7aS5U([k//"G{6^HIbY9X8~+PD($}6szF"&vVxCXSn
 8mw^0G#nVHE%W,`X"[j0s{r.~%zs:O|HFU=LwzYgH

	B. Try viewing it by whatever means you have available.
	C. Go back to step 9, but do it *right* this time.

Thanks to those who responded.

We were able to prevent this behaviour by two methods:

1) running twm rather than olwm
2) keeping olwm, but putting "wmTimeout: 10" in the resources

It has been suggested that the difficuty was something to do with the
window manager positioning the popup window. Any guru who can analyse
what is going on from this information, please post and let us know.

Thanks -- Shirley

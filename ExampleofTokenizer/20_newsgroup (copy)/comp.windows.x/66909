Your might take a look a PLPLOT.  Version 4.99c (actually beta v5.0)
can be found anonymous ftp from hagar.ph.utexas.edu, in the pub/plplot 
directory.

 From the README file of version 4.99c:

 This is the PLPLOT distribution.  PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for
 many systems, small (micro) and large (super) alike.  Despite its small size
 and quickness, it has enough power to satisfy most users, including: standard
 x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots, mesh plots,
 bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes)
 may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each graph.  Different
 line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually infinite number of
 distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are almost 1000 characters in
 the extended character set.  This includes four different fonts, the Greek
 alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and other symbols.  The fonts
 can be scaled to any size for various effects.  Many different output device
 drivers are available (system dependent), including a portable metafile
 format and renderer.

 The PLPLOT package is freely distributable, but NOT in the public domain.
 The PLPLOT source code, except header files and those files explicitly
 granting permission, may not be used in a commercial software package without
 consent of the authors.  You are allowed and encouraged to include the PLPLOT
 object library and header files in a commercial package provided that: (1) it
 is explicitly and prominently stated that the PLPLOT library is freely
 available, and (2) the full copyrights on the PLPLOT package be displayed
 somewhere in the documentation for the package.

 We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code, especially in the form of
 user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes.  If PLPLOT is used in any
 published papers, please include an acknowledgment or citation of our work,
 which will help us to continue improving PLPLOT.  Also, please remember that
 as PLPLOT is not a commercial product, we cannot be expected to offer the
 kind of support that a commercial product may.  There is great interest
 in extending PLPLOT and fixing bugs, but the principal authors can only
 afford to work on it part time.  Improvements will necessarily focus on
 those which help us get our work done.

 PLPLOT is written in C, enabling it to run on many platforms practically
 without modification.  Fortran programs may use it transparently; stub
 routines are provided to handle the C<->Fortran interface without any
 modification of the user program.  C programs are required to include the
 header file "plplot.h"; see the documentation for more details.

 The main documentation for PLPLOT is in the doc/ directory in the form of
 several TeX files; please consult this for additional information ('latex
 plotdoc').  Unfortunately documentation tends to lag actual improvements to
 the code, so don't be surprised if some known features are not explained
 there.  Consult 'Changes.log' to see a list of recent changes.  

 At present, PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems:

	 Unix:	SunOS
		 A/IX 
		 HP-UX
		 Unicos
		 DG/UX
		 Ultrix
		 SysV
		 Linux

	 Amiga/Exec
	 MS-DOS
	 OS/2
	 NeXT

 For more information on how to get or use PLPLOT on your system, see:
  - appendices to the PLPLOT manual
  - system-specific documentation in the appropriate sys/<system> directory.

 PLPLOT is the result of the effort of many people, so it is impractical to
 list all the contributors.   Those currently supporting and otherwise
 responsible for the package in its present form include:

 Maurice LeBrun
 Please send all comments, flames, patches, etc, to me.  I am responsible for
 all the PLPLOT kernel development as well as most of the work on the
 metafile, xwindow, xterm, postscript, tektronix, and Amiga drivers.

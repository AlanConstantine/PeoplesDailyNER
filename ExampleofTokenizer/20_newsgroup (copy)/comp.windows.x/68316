	Help,

	I've got an applications with a series of pushbuttons across
	the top (a toolbar).  I wanted to add eventhandlers to these
	pushbuttons on EnterWindowMask and LeaveWindowMask so that
	I can put up some descriptive text about the function of each
	pushbutton as the pointer crosses over it.

	I've done this fine, but I've turned up the following problem:

	When the pushbuttons are sensitive I get callbacks on both of
	the above events, but when they are not sensitive I only get
	callbacks on LeaveWindow events.  This seems odd.  I would
	expect this to be an all-or-nothing type of thing.

	Is this a bug?  If not, can someone explain this behavior?

	thanks,

	Mark

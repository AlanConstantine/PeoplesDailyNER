In plain Motify using a dialog 'in-line' like this simply isn't done. You need
to set callbacks from the buttons/widgets in your dialog and let the callback routines
do the work. In the callbacks you can then carry on the flow of logic. 

XView from Sun actually supports this very neatly with a 'Notify' box, which can
return a status in-line, it does actualy ease coding but goes against the event
driven style of an application.

Summary: Redesign required.

I know that this is not the correct place to post this, but I have 
exhausted all other logical options.  I used to be on the INFO-UNIX 
newsgroup mailer.  The mailers mysteriously quite coming around the end of
last year.  All e-mails requesting that I be placed back on the list have
been ignored.  I have been unable to locate the administrator of this list.

If anyone knows of the internet address that I can send a the request to
get back on this list, can you please send it to me.  If you don't know
of this specific newsgroup mailer, I would appreciate the address of *any*
UNIX-related newsgroup.  Thanks.

                                       Cutoff,
                                       Steve

PS - Sorry for the non-X-related question.

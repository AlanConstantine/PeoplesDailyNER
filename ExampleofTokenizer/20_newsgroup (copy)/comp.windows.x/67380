X Window installation on a Sun4/470 with CG6 alone and with CG2 as
screen:0.0 and CG6 as screen:0.1.

Questions:
1)  Are there any hardware configuration changes on the CG2 and/or
CG6 devices that need to be made other than pulling out and inserting the
CG2 frame buffer in the vme bus?

2)  The CG6 is called a 'graphics accelerator' as apposed to a 'frame buffer'.
What is the significance of this to the X server and how do we install
the SunOS driver / X to be compatable.

I would appreciate any information on this. 
I am posting this on the behalf of Dr. John Charlton (who does not have net
access). Please reply to him directly at charlton@bme.unc.edu or just send
it at this address and I will forward it. 

Thank you for your help!

X/Motif Gurus,

	How do you handling scaling of X text while performing zooming 
operations  on figures? Is restricting user to select scalable fonts too 
restrictive and  a absolute NO NO?
Any books that have discussion on this topic?  Should have really taken more 
of those Computer Graphics courses but, now its too late -:( )

	I will summarize response.
Thanks in advance.

Animation is most frequently done by copying the the client resident XImages into 
server resident Pixmap(s) using XPutImage.  Once this is done, the original XImages
can be deleted and the animation loop can be performed using XCopyArea from the Pixmaps to the windows drawable.

Hope this is helpfull.

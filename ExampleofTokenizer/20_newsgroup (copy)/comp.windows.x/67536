We are adding a Motif wrapper to a family of data display programs.

These programs are each written as a 'main loop' with these steps:
- use semop to check a semaphore and if true access new data
  otherwise block (new data comes quite often)
- use msgop to check for messages and if true read them
  otherwise continue (messages are user commands and not often)
- update the display according to latest data and messages.

We typically have several of these running in windows,
plus a data producer serving some device and setting the flag.
Everyone blocking makes sure the device server gets to run.

Xt and Xm also have a 'main loop' model that we must fit into.
O'Reilly Vol IV Ch 9 discusses adding a file-watcher and also
how to add workprocs that are run during idle time.

We can 'open-up' our existing main loop and call it as a workproc.
The problem is our blocking until new data is no longer appropriate.
Neither is letting the program free-run because others are hurt.

The unix select call lets you block until any of several i/o are ready.
We want that for the X main loop except not file i/o.
Any suggestions or examples most welcome!

We run SGI Personal Iris and Indigo systems.

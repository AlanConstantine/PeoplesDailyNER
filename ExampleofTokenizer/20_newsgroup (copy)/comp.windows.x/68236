We have Suns running SunOS 4.1.3 and Openwindows 3.0 (X11R4). We have
used Xvision on a PC, setup to broadcast query to the UNIX xdm servers and
allow a user to choose a UNIX client in which to login: xdm will then
manage that display. I would like to do the same thing with xfree86
running under Linux, but I don't know how. I don't want to hardwire the UNIX
xdm to manage the PC displays as the PC's are not always running Linux 
(let alone xfree86). I would like the same setup as provided by Xvision.

Can anybody help?
Thanks,

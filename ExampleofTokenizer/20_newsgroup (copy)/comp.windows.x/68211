I need some help in tracking down a dvi viewer for X. I have xdvi but we
have not got the X libraries and includes installed- so 
		i) is there a way around this, as we are trying to avoid
		   installing the stuff (space is at a premium).
		ii)would someone be prepared to make the binaries
		   available. We have a HP700 and a HP382.

	Thanks for any help

Hi folks,

Can anyone give me some information, the location of some
information, or some reference material for the following
file formats: WIFF, MO;DCA/IOCA, PCX.

If this is not quite the appropriate place to ask such
questions, please let me know a more appropriate one and
accept my apologies in advance.

Thanks for your help,

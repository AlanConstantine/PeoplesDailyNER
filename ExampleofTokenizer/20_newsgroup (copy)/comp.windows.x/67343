We have a program written with X11R5 and Motif 1.2.1.  It runs fine on the Sun
X11R5 server and MacX.  When that program is run under the Sparc 2 and the
OW server, the program crashed itself along with the server.  It crashed before
the first window had showed up.

I got the following error from X.
XIO:  fatal IO error 32 (Broken pipe) on X server "perot:0.0"
      after 62 requests (59 known processed) with 0 events remaining.
      The connection was probably broken by a server shutdown or KillClient.

I have run the program with xmon and below is the last twenty lines or so from
xmon before both the program and server crashed.

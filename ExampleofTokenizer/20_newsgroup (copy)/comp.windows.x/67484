How do you solve the problem when the message "Cannot perform malloc"
shows for XtCreateManagedWidget call?

I have the application written in X11R5 running on DECstation using
Athena widgets.  As soon as I added codes to do Remote Procedure Call,
the program refused to work.  I also have my program working using
just Xlib calls with RPC.  My executable code is about 1.4M and I don't
have any idea how much memory is the DECstation 3100/5100.

Any help will be appreciated.  Thanks.

You are stuck in a distributed system feedback loop!  What if you are on an
Xterminal or running xterm over the net to another machine?  That is when the
load problems occur.  If you had a machine with 20 Xterminals attached and
they all had blinking cursors in xterm's, this could represent a considerable
ethernet bandwidth waste.

I'm not picking on you, just people keep forgetting that there is a lot of life
out there besides distributed or singleuser "Workstations"!

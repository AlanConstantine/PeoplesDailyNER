A few days ago there was a posting in this group by Andrea Winkler
titled "X and Security / X Technical Conference".  I was one of the
instructors of that tutorial.  Unfortunately, my system purged
the message before I had a chance to see it, and I don't have
Andrea's email address.  If someone has Andrea's address and/or
the posting, I would really appreciate it if you'd forward it to
me!

Thanks

NCD just announced a new generation of PC-Xview. They
changed the name a little though and I can't remember
exactly... PC-Xsomething.

It now supports Windows and their press release
implies that since it's still priced in the $500 range
and it's so feature-full why buy anything else?

never used the product.)

I'm trying to turn on Xauthorization using MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE on my servers
(CPU heads, HP700RX Xterminals), but I'm running into a couple of problems.

First, at least one of our applications (Maple) doesn't seem to understand 
how to deliver the magic cookie, and won't run on a display with authorization
turned on. 

Second, we have people with client software on remote machines, and I
really don't want to hassle them with having to copy their .Xauthority
file to the remote machine... assuming that the clients there support
Xauthorization.

So, what I would like to do is turn on MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE by default, with
non-privileged users able to turn it off - dropping back to host-based
authorization.

(Yes, I know how to turn it off by changing the Xconfig file for the
heads and the Client Authorize setting for the Xterminals, but
non-privileged users can't do this.)

I've checked with the HP Support Line, and there doesn't appear to be a way.
Can anyone confirm this, or do you know of a way to accomplish what I
want?

BTW, I'm running HPUX 9.0, and Vue 3.0.

Thanks in advance,
Rick

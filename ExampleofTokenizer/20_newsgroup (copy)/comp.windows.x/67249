Hello--  I'm currently designing the architecture of a chip which is
intended to help speed up common operations on a windowing system such as
X.  A friend and I are designing the chip as the final course project for
an advanced computer architecture course taught by Dr. Fred Brooks at
UNC-Chapel Hill.  While we feel that we've got a pretty solid design
currently, we'd really like to get ahold of some frequency data from an
X-Windows server so that we can make the most effective use of our bit
budget.  

Unfortunately, I've been unable to find anything of this sort in the
various X FAQs, or X manuals that I've seen.  Does anyone have some type of
frequency data, like how many Copy-rectangle operations vs draw-lines, and
things of that sort?  Or, barring that, a program that records requests to
the server into a logfile that I can munge on myself?

Any and all help would be very appreciated.

Many thanks,
    ---Mark

Another company, Congruent Corporation of New York City, has also ported Xlib
Xt and Motif 1.1 over to MS Windows NT, which provides full client development
for X applications in an NT environment.

If you are porting InterViews over to MS Windows, I thought InterViews was
a C++ toolkit with C++ classes. If that is so, how can it be built on Xlib,
unless the classes are calling Xlib functions?

I'm an new to this.  Having found some files (public) to look into, I
ftp'ed them to a system I have access to.  I then used kermit to transmit
them via modem to my host computer, a PC-based file system.  I access
internet through modem access to a university mainframe.  From the PC
file server, I pull the files to a disk, and then pull them from disk
to a SGI Indigo (the SGI is not networked yet).  When I try to uncompress
and un-tar the files, they either come out as garbage or I get an error
in the tar process about directories being invalid.
What I'm wondering about is the transfer of UNIX files (compressed,
binary,ascii) about multiple platforms.  My guess is that it is the copy
to a 'dos' disk that is screwing things up.  Any help is appreciated.

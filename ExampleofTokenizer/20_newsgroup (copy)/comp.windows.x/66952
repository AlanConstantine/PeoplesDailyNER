One can't.  The application may not have been started from a terminal
emulator; if it was, the terminal emulator may not still exist, and if
it does it may be in no condition to be "pop[ped] to the top" (eg, it
may be iconified).  And even if you can, it may not do what you want -
consider a virtual-root window manager like tvtwm, with the relevant
window in a portion of the virtual desktop that's outside the real
desktop.

Some (but not all) X terminal emulators provide environment variables
giving a window ID.  Even if such a thing is present in the
environment, it may not be what you want; it may correspond to a window
on a different server, for example.

Does any one out there have experience with Planet X, I am
considering buying it to use on a SPARCstation IPC, in this
way I can run Mac programs from the SPARC.

Would you recommend buying this piece of Software and what is
the emulation on the SPARC like?  Does it give a window of a
Mac or does it give a window of just the individual programs?

Any information would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Dean

	Text & Graphics:
	Bristol Technologies has help clone of MSWindows help
	Frame (makers of FrameMaker) has FrameView

	Text only:
	Graphical Software Technology has Xtra Widgets (includes help)

	There are probably others (check out ICS widget data book)

It was a good one too! (IMHO and totally unbiased view of things) ;-)

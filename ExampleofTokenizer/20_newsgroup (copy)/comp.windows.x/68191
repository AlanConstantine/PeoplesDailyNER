  Hello, I hope this is the right group to post this in.
  I've got a little problem.  I finally managed to get a REAL operating
system (Linux, as opposed to MS-Dos) and I like it alot.  But, when I
try to run 'startx', I get a strange response: My monitor goes into
graphics mode and I get this big white rectangle on the screen - that's
all! Nothing else!  Now, I've collected almost every FAQ in the world to
help me but either it's too confusing or I must be missing something.
  My setup:
	386DX (about 20Mhz)
	Trident 8900C SVGA (w/1 Meg)
	4 MB RAM
	Plenty of HD space
Any help is appreciated.
Thanx.

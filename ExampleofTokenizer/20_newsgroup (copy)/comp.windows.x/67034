What does this have to do with my original question???  I previously
stated that I did an XCopyArea of the depth-8 pixmap to the screen
just to make sure that my image had data, and it did.  This is NOT
a problem with expose events, it has to do with XCopyPlane not
working!!!

Does anyone have a code fragment they could send demonstrating that
XCopyPlane works???  This would be very helpful!

Thanks!

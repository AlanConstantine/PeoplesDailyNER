Hi,

I'm working on a project that involves storing an application's rendering
to an X display and then playing it back again.  Rather than 
"reinvent the wheel", it like to find:
	* a file format for saving X protocol.
	* software that saves and replays such a session.

Any ideas out there?  I've heard that there is a version of Xscope
that will save and replay sessions.

I'd be willing to share much of the code I develop back to the X community.

Hello folks,

I'm seeing these errors when I try to modify my key map:

mwm: invalid accelerator specfication, line x

I've added a line in the start up file before the line
that starts mwm. It looks like the following:

xmodmap keymapfile
mwm

I think that the problem has to do with a conflict between
function keys F1 through F7 which already have assigned
functions (e.g. Move, Minimize, etc).

The odd thing is that I don't see these errors if I run

xmodmap keymapfile

from an xterm.

Can anyone suggest a way to modify the key map, specifically
F1 through F7 AND not have mwm (Motif Window Manager) complain.

I realize this is a bit stupid, but we only have time to
implement, not time to learn how to implement.

Terry

Has anyone found a fix for the following problem?

Client Software:	SunOs 4.1.1, X11R5
Server Hardware:	Sun IPC
Server Software:	SunOs 4.1.1, Open Windows 3.0 (w/ patch 100444-37)

A Motif 1.2.2 application will periodically hang when run against the
OpenWindows 3.0 server (xnews). The pulldown is displayed but then no
button actions have any effect. Sometimes pressing <Return> will
unstick the application but not usually. It looks like the pulldown is
grabbing the focus and never letting go. Other windows on the display
continue to get updated so the server isn't hanging. If I log in from
another terminal and kill the Motif application then everything gets
back to normal. The same application when run against other X servers
(including MIT X11R5 Xsun, DecWindows, Tektronix X terminal) has no
problems. This is obviously a OpenWindows problem but I need a
work-around since most of our customers are OpenWindows users.

I have tried the following things:

    1. Installing the latest version of the OpenWindows server patch
       (100444-37).

    2. Using mwm (version 1.2.2) instead of olwm.

    3. Applying the patch specified in the Motif FAQ (question 110).
       This had the effect of disabling the point-and-click method of
       menu interaction (as opposed to the click-and-drag method), and
       screwing up the menu mnemonics keys. It did seem to help, but I
       was still able to get the application to hang.

Repeat By:

This is an intermittent problem so you'll have to try several times.

Click and release on a menu heading (pulldown menu will pop up)

Click and release on a menu item

Repeat until application hangs


Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.

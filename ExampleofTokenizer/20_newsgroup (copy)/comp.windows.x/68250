It is true that the man page for pageview does not say that the files need
to be DSC compliant.  That is the fault of the left hand not knowing what the
right hand is doing at Sun.  I was informed by a Sun employee that the pageview
program does require DSC compliant PostScript.  There was the possibility that
it was going to be changed so that if the file wasn't DSC compliant that it
would stop at each showpage.  I believe that this method would preclude being
able to go backwards and forwards through the file, i.e., you could only go
forward to the next showpage.  This isn't in OW3.0 pageview, but maybe it is
in the Solaris 2.x version of OW (OW 3.1?).

In any event, I find pageview extremely useful.  Since all of the PostScript
that I produce IS DSC compliant, I don't have any problems.

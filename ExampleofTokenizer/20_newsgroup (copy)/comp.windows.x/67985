# Does anyone know if the following is possible, and if so how do I go about
# doing it.
# 
# I want to be able to display remote X11 applications on a VAXstation 2000 off
# of an Internet node. Here is where the problem comes up, the VAXstation isn't
# connected directly to the Internet but is connected via Decnet to a node that
# does have a connection to the Internet. Does anyone know if it is possible to
# get the display to use TCPIP from the remote Internet node down to my local
# Internet node and then send it via Decnet down to the VAXstation 2000?

For the machine that is connected to the InterNet, what is it running?  If it
is running VMS, then if you obtain MultiNet for it, MultiNet comes with a
TCP/IP to DECnet gateway for X11.

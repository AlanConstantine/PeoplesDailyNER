I am developing an X (Xt,Xm) application that will include a graphics window
of some sort with moving symbols among other things.  A pure X application
could be implemented with Motif widgets, one of which would be an 
XmDrawingArea for drawing with Xlib.  But I would like to take advantage of
the Graphics Library (GL) available on our IBM RS/6000 (SGI's GL i believe).

Is it possible to mix X and GL in one application program?
Can I use GL subroutines in an XmDrawingArea or in an X window opened by me
with XOpenWindow?

I have never used GL before, but the doc on GL winopen() says that the first
time winopen() is called it opens a connection to the server.   Also, most of
the GL calls do not require a Display or GC, unlike most X calls.  From this
initial information it appears that X and GL cannot be mixed easily.   Is this
true?

Does PEX (graPHIGS?) have the same functionality of GL?


Environment:
     AIXwindows X11R4
     Motif 1.1
     GL is available
     AIX Sys V 3.2
     IBM RS/6000 360


Thanks in advance.

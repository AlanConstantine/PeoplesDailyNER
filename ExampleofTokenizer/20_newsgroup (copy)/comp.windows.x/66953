As applied to servers, the first three are fuzzy terms.  "multi-headed"
tends to be used for any system with multiple monitors, sometimes even
multiple screens even if they're multiplexed onto the same monitor (eg,
a Sun with a cg4 display).  "multi-screen" and "multi-display" would,
if taken strictly, mean different things, but since the strict meaning
of "multi-display" would refer to a system with multiple keyboards and
pointers, when it's used it probably refers to the same thing
"multi-screen" would: a system that provides multiple Screens.

"zaphod" is a term applied to the way the MIT server switches the
pointer from one screen to another by sliding it off the side of the
screen.

There is a protocol limitation that restricts a given Display to at
most 255 Screens.  I know of no server that handles multiple Displays
on a single invocation, unless possibly my kludges to the R4 server can
be looked upon as such; on a TCP-based system there is necessarily a
limit of 65535 Displays per machine, but this is not a limitation
inherent to X.

What you read was most likely talking about a limit in some particular
implementation (probably the MIT one).  If it claimed there was a limit
of 12 inherent to X, the author of the article had no business writing
about X.

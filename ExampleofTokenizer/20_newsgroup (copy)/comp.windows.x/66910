I have a peculiar color problem with MacX, Apple's Macintosh X server.
I'd like to know if others have seen the same problem. It's happened
with the current version (1.2), and with version 1.1.7.
When some types of client windows are displayed, parts of the windows
are in the wrong color; if the window is moved slightly, forcing the server
to repaint it, it is repainted in the correct colors. It doesn't happen
for xterm windows, but has happened for graphic windows and with some
Motif clients.

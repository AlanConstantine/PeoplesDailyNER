I would further add that a 486/50,S3/928,8mb,15",200mbDISK is going to cost
/WAY/ more than $900, probably $3,000.  Color makes it not apples/apples too.
Xterminals provide better price/performance than PCs.  You can make a PC
much cheaper, and perform much worse, and you can make PC's perform great, and
cost more.  You pay extra for the additional functinality and expandability
of a PC.  For home user, that extra functionality is worth the added cost.

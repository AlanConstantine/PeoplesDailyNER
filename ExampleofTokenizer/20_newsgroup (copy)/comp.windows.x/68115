I need some advice regarding monitor to use with Xfree86. I have an ET4000
based graphic card with 1 Meg of memory. I know this card is supported in
Xfree86 because a friend of mine has one of these in his PC. His monitor is
17" colour capable of displaying 1280x1024 resolution. I cant afford this kind
of expensive monitor. I heard from somewhere that Xfree86 requires multisync
monitor with minimum horizontal scan frequency of 60KHz. Is this true?
I would only like to use Xfree86 at resolution of 800x600 in 256 colours and
so was thinking of buying a cheap 14" SVGA monitor. Interlaced (Cheap)14" SVGA 
monitors only have have maximum horizontal scan frequency of about 38KHz.
Will this kind of monitor work with Xfree86? 

Please reply by email.

Thaks in advance.

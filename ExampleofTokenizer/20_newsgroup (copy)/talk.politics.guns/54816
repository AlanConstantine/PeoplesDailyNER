# So the Blue PRess suggests that we bankrupt HCI by requesting information
# and the concern by list members is that HCI will claim everyone that calls
# as a new member.  I think they will. I also think they will claim a new
# MANDATE to ban all firearms from the solar system wheter we call and ask for
# information or not!
# 
# On the other hand, with due respect to the Editor of the Blue PRess, just
# becaue Mike makes damned good presses, dies, powder scales, and got tired of
# Lee's atacks DOES NOT MEAN THAT EVERY DILLON FAN FOLLOWS WHAT MIKE CALLS FOR
# LIKE HE WAS KARESH AND WE WERE TRANSDILLIDIANS!

# Our local State Assemblyman has called for a complete ban on all non-bolt
# action military rifles and all assault weapons, a 7 day wait for purchase
# permits { it currently takes 10 to 14 working days here in NC } and one
# permit/year. The flood of calls he got was 7 for and 3 against. Guess who
# called supporting his move? Guess what ILA is doing? Right?

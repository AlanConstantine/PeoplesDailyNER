And another survivor claims he heard someone shouting "The fire's started!".
Odd terminology.  That's what one says when you know a fire is planned, not 
when one occurs by accident.  We will have to wait and see what the evidence 
shows, assuming one is willing to believe any evidence offered by the 
"distrustful ones".

Neither.  Again I was merely addressing the sanity level of the players.  
I agree that the BATF handled the affair badly from day one.  BTW, I heard 
on the news today that the affadavit behind the no-knock warrant was unsealed 
today.  Grenade launcher was the only thing on the list that I found 
unusual.

Ambitious news reporters could use the documentary filmed by an Australian 
in 1992 on the compound grounds to help identify survivors.  I, for one, 
will check their stories for consistency with what I learned in a long 
news story about that documentary.

Certainly there is some room for doubt.  I certainly reserve the right 
to change my opinions when new evidence warrants such a change.  If I 
were conspiratorially minded, however, I would never be able to change 
my mind, because any evidence I disliked would have to be a lie 
fabricated by the "distrustful ones".

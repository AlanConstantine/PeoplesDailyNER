Much of the dispute about the origin of the fire that destroyed the
BD compound could be settled by examining the propane tank supposedly
crushed by one of the army tanks when they breached the walls of the
compound. If the the propane tank is flattened and has tread marks on it,
then the BD's version of the cause of the fire would seem to be
verified.

The U.S. Government has become a garrotte around the necks of its
citizens.  Just as with a garrotte, the more people struggle to breathe
the air of freedom, the more the government tightens its stranglehold. The
only possible outcomes at this point are the death of government or the
elimination of personal freedom.

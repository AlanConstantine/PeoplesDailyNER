    The lethality in small part, but mostly what I found frightening 
was the fact that they were wielded by people who believed that they 
ate breakfast every morning with Jesus Christ. Now I wasn't there in 
Galilee back in the Roman occupation, so I don't know for certain that 
David Koresh was not Jesus Christ, but I strongly suspect that he was 
not (even aside from the fact of never having seen them in a photograph 
together).

    I admit I can't cite a specific, but if there isn't a law against 
purchasing grenade components and assembling them into functioning units 
then perhaps we need one. All second ammendment arguments aside, I'm just 
not sure that I like the idea of private citizens with hand grenades.

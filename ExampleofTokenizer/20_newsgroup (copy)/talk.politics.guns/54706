The U.S. Government's campaign of persecution and genocide against the
Branch Davidians was a resounding success.

Heil Clinton!  Heil Reno!  The Gestapo is alive and well and living in
Washington, D.C.

Kevin, who agrees that David Koresh was probably a first-rate nutcase
       but who firmly believes that the Bill of Rights guaranteed his
       his right to be a religious fanatic and that the government is
       guilty of violating his civil rights and of 1st degree murder.

       are we going to persecute next and are we going to torch their
       church with a rolled up copy of the Constitution?

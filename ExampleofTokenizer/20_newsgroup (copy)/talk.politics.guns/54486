Just to shed some light on the fire, it was widely reported (AP, etc.) that
there WERE several witnesses to BD folks starting the fires.  It has also
been reported that the fires broke out in several places at once, which
rules out a Bradley knocking over a lamp, etc. as the cause.

What I would like to see is some serious discussion of this incident.  I
believe the moves made were right and proper, but I still have some problems
with some of the tactics.  After watching the ABC special on it tonight, as
well as CNN and Nightline, I question some of the ATF and FBI actions.

1) Could it have been possible to have taken Koresh outside the compound at
some time before the Feb. 28th raid?

2) Could a further wait have resulted in a different outcome.

3) Were FBI actions (blaring loudspeakers, etc.) the "right" course of action?

And a few other questions.  Like I said, I believe the actions taken, in
general, were proper.  But I still have some reservations.

One other point, I'm no fan of Janet Reno, but I do like the way she had the
"balls" to go ahead and take full responsibility.  Seems like the waffle boy
had problems figuring out just where he stood on the issue.

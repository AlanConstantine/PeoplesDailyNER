I have NEVER spoken for a ban against guns in America !
What I've said is that there seems to be to MANY of them, and especially
to many in wrong hands....

Now IF you would like to reduce the number, how would you do it without affecting
good/responcible gun owners ??


I DO believe in a persons freedom.
What I don't believe is that you can have it all and don't pay for it.

MOST europeans believe in a society of individuals, and that you HAVE
to give 'a little' to make that society work.

Cars and guns should really not be mixed, I just tried to make a point.
Like America, Norway has some spaces you have to cross to get from a to b,
so a car is essential in most parts....

Guns on the other hand are not essential in Norway, so we don't 
argue that IF we 'banned' guns we HAVE to ban cars.....


EVERYONE who believe that Hitler and WW2 could be avoided if there were
more guns in Germany in the 30's: PLEASE read some HISTORY!


Is this discussion about

1. Banning weapons for ALL Americans
            or
2. Making it harder for criminals to get one ??



Change of name.......
Wrote that one after reading the first postings about the Waco 'incident'.
I still think there are 'some' posters should move their post to alt.conspiracy
or make a new newsgroup.
(If you read the first postings after the Waco fire you should see who I mean......)

Did the BATF get the warrant for a gun search only or was there other reasons.
(Child abuse for instance)

Doesn't the people reading this newsgroup have access to the clari.news.* hierarcy ??
(Some seems rather mis/unInformed)

(Or is the clari.news.* hierarcy ruled and censored by the corrupt facist goverment??)

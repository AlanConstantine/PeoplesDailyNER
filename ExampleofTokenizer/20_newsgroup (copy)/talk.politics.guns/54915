Post all you want, foreigner.  We'd rather hear from you
than those "I'll support the fascist who writes the
hecks for my salary" .edu site types!

Should you expect the Police to come in and
assault you, lay siege and refuse to help when they
(yes, let's give them the benefit of the doubt)
accidently burn down your ranch home?  Even though
ey have emergency vehicles nearby?

Is this a proper response when you just keep to yourself?
Even if you DON'T hurt anyone?  And you
're cooperative with cops when you occasionally come out?

I hope not.

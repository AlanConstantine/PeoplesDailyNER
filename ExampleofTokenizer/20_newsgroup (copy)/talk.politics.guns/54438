:According to an Australian documentary made in the year before the stand off

I don't know how accurate the documentary was; however, Koresh was never
convicted of any crimes against children, nor was the BATF after him for
child abuse.  Their purview (in this case) is strictly in firearms violations,
so this information is irrelevant to the discussion.

:Koresh's own prophecy?

Those in charge will undoubtedly have to explain *something*, but whether
their answers even remotely resembles the truth we may never know.  And who
is left alive to care whether the prophecy is fulfilled?  It only holds
meaning for the nine who survived.

:>Correction:  The *FBI* said that two of the cult members said this; so far,
:>no one else has been able to talk to them.

:So, when they talk to the news reporters directly, and relate the same 
:details, will you believe them?

*IF* they confirm the story, I probably will.  Definitely not until then, 
however.

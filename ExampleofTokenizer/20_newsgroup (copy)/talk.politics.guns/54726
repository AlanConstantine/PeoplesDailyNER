This was reported in Canadian papers Thursday, 22 April - I _think_ the
source was UPI, but don't recall for certain.

I understand that at least two goverment investigations have been ordered,
so we may learn more during their hearings.

Tough call without more investigation, but if the thermal imaging story
holds up, I think the government will be more credable... of course,
paranoia fans won't believe their results anyway, will they?

Hear, hear! I'd also like to see the autopsy reports confirm news reports
that multiple victims were found shot (in the head), and in positions
inconsistent with fire victims. It is simply too early to draw conclusions
either way about this nasty incident, but I tend to believe the government
side.

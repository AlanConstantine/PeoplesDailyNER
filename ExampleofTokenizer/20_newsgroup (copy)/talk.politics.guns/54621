You're sitting in your home reading a good book.  Your neighbors think
you're a quiet, upstanding citizen.  A random person anonymously calls 
the authorities and tells them you beat your children, sleep with all 
the neighbor wimmen, and own a bunch of "nasty 50mm machine guns."  

Now what are they supposed to do?

Ah, I see.  They're supposed to send 100 men in horse trailers with
automatic weapons, storm onto your roof, and throw grenades at your 
house with no warning.  Then, after subjecting you to noise torture
and telling the national news media for a month what a filthy son of 
a bitch you are, they're supposed to gas you and knock your house 
around a bit until they manage to collapse it, cause a fire, or 
something equally conclusive.

Hope your neighbors don't tumble to this -- at least none of them that
might have a craving for a ringside seat at some cheap but dramatic 
local entertainment at someone else's expense.  Or maybe even
PARTICULARLY at your expense.

At least they won't have to read you your rights, Joe -- obviously you
had no use for them anyway.

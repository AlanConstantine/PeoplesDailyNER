I just got through listening to the 10 o'clock news on Channel 4 here in
Dallas. They trotted out a list of justifications produced by the ATF after
"months of investigation" for their raid. 

I couldn't believe the junk on this list! For example, the BDs were accused
of stockpiling a bunch of "9mm and .223 ammunition that can be used in M15
and M16 assault rifles". Imagine that--they had ammunition!  They also had
aluminum dust! (Yeah, it's a component of thermite, but so far I haven't
heard that it's illegal to take a grinder to the aluminum lawn
furniture...) The only thing on the list that could conceivably have been
illegal was an M-79 grenade launcher. (Anybody know about this?)

Months of investigation! For this 80+ people died!

I will join the ranks here.  If someone has the ability to actually put this
thing together and get enough support, I'll also contribute $1000 to the 
effort.  And jeeze, people, I'm a *student*, with *no job* yet, and I will
put up my own hard-earned savings if it means we have a shot at getting
the truth told on the airwaves.  Count me in.

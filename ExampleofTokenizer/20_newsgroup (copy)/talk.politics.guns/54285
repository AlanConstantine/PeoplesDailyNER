Fellow Texans and Members of Crime Strike in Texas
 
Crime Strike in Texas has a loosely knit coalition with most
Victims Rights Groups in Texas. We ask that you write a
letter protesting the release of the following murderer.
 
This letter should be written to :
 
Raven Kazen - Victims Services
Board of Pardons and Paroles
P.O. Box 13401 - Capital Station
Austin, Texas 78711
 
The letter should be written if at all possible on RED PAPER
as that was agreed on at one of our first meetings . It
represents the coalition and all of its parts as well as the
heart ache of those left behind and the blood spilled by
these criminals. The letter should have only one name on it
so it can be filed in the folder of that criminal waiting for
his next try at parole.
 
List of Criminals:
 
Today we have only one parole to protest , On October 4,
1990, Mark Steven Hughes rendered numerous blows to the head
of James Allen Pompa . Ten month old James went into a coma
and died two days later.
 
On July 8, 1992, Mark Steven Hughes pled guilty to Injury to
a Child and received a ten-year sentence. According to Texas
law, Mark became eligible for parole on January 4, 1992 --
six months before he was even sentenced!
 
Would you join us in strongly protesting the release from
prison of Mark Steven Hughes, who beat a baby to death .
 
Mark Steven Hughes - beat to death the baby boy of
Russel Pompa -- Reference Mark Steven Hughes - TDC# 633546
 
 
Mark your envelope   "PROTEST LETTER" on the front and back.
 
A typical letter is indicated on the next page ---
 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

I protest the parole of Mark Steven Hughes TDC#633546, who,
murdered James Son of Russel Pompa.
 
He should be kept in prison for his full sentence and not be
released at any time prior to his full sentence for any
reason.

Really?  How do you avoid situations which encourage criminals?  I'd
really like to know.  Would you, say, prohibit female college
students from riding their bicycles near the university during the
daytime?  

Sounds a bit drastic, doesn't it?  Especially when the university is
locatd in a nice residential area.  A friend of mine was attacked and
nearly raped in just this situation.  The police didn't feel she was
in a situation which 'encouraged criminals'.

What do you think?  Should we just tell her, that it was her fault
for daring to ride a bicycle in the middle of the day?  That she
didn't avoid a situation that encouraged criminals?  If that's the
case, then we'd all better put bars on our doors and windows and
pray for a police state to keep us all safe.  Crime happens in all
situations - there are no defined areas that criminals avoid.

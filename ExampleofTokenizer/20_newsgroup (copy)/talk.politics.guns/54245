That depends only on the profit of doing so.  The differences
in cost of production will determine local vs smuggle.

Those of us who have actually made semi-autos (full-autos are easier)
are getting quite a giggle out of this.  I'd estimate that 5% of
the people at my high school couldn't do it.  (I was one of the
few who failed shop.)  People who have actually seen me do mechanical
work would probably say that 1% is more like it.

Starting with even 90% of the population, you can be sure that
"enough" people will be motivated.

How much is "through the nose"?  After all, we know quite a bit
about how much a gun is worth to a criminal, so if that is dwarfed
by the price demanded by the "bad" part of that 90%....

The relevant economic analysis has been made.  The "profit" of
gun crime is high enough that the price required to push criminals
out of the market is high enough that everyone will be motivated.
That analysis ignored some "improvements" in the criminal gun
market that could make them even cheaper.  (They're not efficiently
used now, but a "loaner" set up would drive the value still higher
without affecting criminal use.)

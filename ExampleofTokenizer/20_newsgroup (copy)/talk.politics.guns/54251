   I agree very much.  I have read almost every article written about
   the Glock, and IMO, it is probably the safest auto-loader made.  It
   has the best safty of all, Jeff Cooper's First Rule, "Keep your finger
   OFF the trigger until you want to shoot."  If everyone just observed
   this, there would be fewer "accidents".

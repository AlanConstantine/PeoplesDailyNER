According to an AP report (from Texas, written by Jaime Aron) this morning,
in addtion to the gas pumped in by hoses from CS generators, canisters of
tear gas were thrown into the building from armored vehicles, one of the
canisters hitting a man inside in the face.

This was in the part of the article *before* going into differences in

Tear gas canisters *used* to be able to start fires...

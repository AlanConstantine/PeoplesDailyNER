Then by your logic, the Jews in Europe in the 1930's were the cause for
the Holocaust.  Hitler told them to leave and because they didn't they
brought the whole thing on themselves.  Because as you say, they could
have COME OUT of Germany.

Same for the Jews in Europe 1930's.

You don't see any evidence of the abuse -- therefore it must be taking place?
As you point out everwhere but here, it is irrelevant to this case.  The
ATF is not in charge of investigating child abuse.

In obvious contradiction to the statements made by the F. B. I.

And just what are those actions that you are judging them by?
Their refusal to let the government control their lives? Their refusal
to submit to unconstitutional laws?  Their refusal to behave like
cowards?  Some of Texas' heros could have taken the cowardly way
out too and surrendered the Alamo.  After all, all they had to do was
COME OUT.  They stayed as you say by their "OWN CHOICE".  Problem
is not everyone chooses to act like a groveling dog in the face of
insurmountable odds.  But as you point out, they certainly do have
that right.

Bull.  They did, in fact, live a quiet, religious life -- as they claimed.
The warrant was not issued because they "stockpiled weapons".  It is
not against the law to own as many guns as you want -- yet (Except in 
Virginia).The warrant was issued for some "gun parts" that are about the size 
of a half-dollar.  Certainly worth the lives of so many people, don't you 
think?

You can forget that WE business.  I certainly do blame them.

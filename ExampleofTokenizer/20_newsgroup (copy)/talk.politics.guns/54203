What's "loosing?"

I vote.  I don't consider RKBA an abomination.

I'm sure Sarah Brady would be delighted to hear your ranting and
raving.  However, Clinton has not publically stated that he would
like to repeal the Second Amendment.  "Tough titty" to you.

Are we going to "make do without" like the people in New York City? 
You know New York City: That gun ban utopia you dream about, with
the millions of unregistered handguns?  New York City, by the way,
has a very high crime rate.

Perhaps you should know about a gungrabber's nightmare - Idaho.
Here in Idaho, the police give concealed carry permits to anyone
over 21 without a criminal record.  There are no gungrabber schemes
such as FOIDs, waiting periods, "gun a month," or LTCs.  And horror
of horrors!  You don't even NEED a permit to carry a concealed
weapon while outside of city limits (although you do need a permit
for concealed carry in an automobile).

I feel a hell of a lot safer in Boise than I would in your gun ban
dream state (e.g., Washington, D.C.).

>The press is against you, the public (the voting public) is against
>you, the flow of history is against you ... this is it !

The voting public in Idaho is staunchly pro-gun.  Both senators
are NRA-endorsed "A" rated!  Buy a clue, pal.

Get out your wallet and buy another clue.  There are millions upon
MILLIONS of pre-1968 (i.e., non-4473'ed) firearms out there.
They have a half-life approaching eternity.  And cosmoline is not
exactly tracked by the feds.

Gun control laws were passed to PROTECT the KKK from blacks!

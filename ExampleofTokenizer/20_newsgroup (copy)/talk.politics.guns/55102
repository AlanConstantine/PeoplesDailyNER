Last time I checked, "amassing an arsenal" and practicing any kind of
religion were mentioned in passing in the Bill of Rights.  Guess it's
OK with you if we just brush 'em aside in order to justify killing
a bunch of religious nutcakes, eh?

Of all the idiots I run into in daily life, Dan, your type scare me the
most.  You'll accept expediency and a coward's safety over any belief
just as long as the government tells you to.  You assume that anyone who
doesn't comform to your beliefs and ways of thinking are wrong and
therefore bad.  Worse, you seem to accept without question what the
government says is wrong to be wrong.

David Koresh's religion was not mine but then again, neither are the baptists,
methodists, catholics or any of the rest of the corporate religions.  BUT
even though Koresh's, the Baptists, the methodists, etc, don't believe
the same way I do, I recognize that their religions are equally valid
to mine and more importantly are equally protected under the 1st Amendment.
You see, I'm not that much different than Koresh and I suspect many others
fit the same catagory.  I read the Bible many times and as I learned 
from it, I discovered that a lot of what corporate religions practice
just isn't justified by MY interpretation of the Bible.  Therefore I go
my own way.  So did Koresh.  And neither you nor I nor anyone else,
either individually or collectively as the great socialist "we" has ANY 
RIGHT WHATSOEVER to tell me or you or Koresh that our religions are wrong.

You seem to think that it would have been oh so easy for the Davidians to
just forsake everything they believed in and walk out of their compound
in order to "save themselves".  Think (if you're capable) for a moment
about some belief you hold dearest.  Would you abandon that belief if
suddenly told to do so by the government?  If you would do so you are
beneath contempt.  Let's assume you have a belief that you hold dear
enough to commit your life to.  Do you think it would be the correct
course of action for your government to initiate actions specifically
designed to force you to make that "forsake or die" decision?

The "forsake or die" option is exactly what the government forced on the
Davidians the day the first wave of black-clad stormtroopers fired that
first shot and tossed that first grenade.  The FBI clenched it on Day 51
when they sent in heavy armor against 80-some-odd men, women and
children holed up in a rickety old building and armed with small arms.  The
people who stayed, who held to their beliefs over personal safety, whose
individual personal honors demanded they die rather than submit, who
believed that the Bill of Rights meant exactly what it says, to those
people go my deepest respect, regardless of their religion.  People like
you who blithely blow off the murder of 80 people with "well they could
have come out" get my most scornful contempt.  I'd spit in your face
were there not a network between us.  You're not worth the ashes of
those people who burned.

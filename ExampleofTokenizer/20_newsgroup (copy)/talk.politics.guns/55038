  BUT...  Suppose they had waited.  The WORST outcome would have been the
one that actually did.  But with the FBI/ATF just standing there watching
instead of being a part of the problem.  It then would have been very clear
exactly who was at fault then, rather than the way it turned out.

  AND, that would have been the WORST case.  The best would have been, they
finally get hungry and come out.  Possible/likely?  Well, the alternative was
worse...

  But what does it matter?  Why say "I don't remember...." when it doesn't
make any difference?  Altho the clintonettes have been pretty good at lying
when it wasn't necessary, they didn't do it this time.  But it wasn't 
necessary - claiming full responsibility is a totall meaningless gesture.
Symbolism over substance - again!  

  I've offered to take full responsibility.  When do they pay me the big
bucks the AG is making...????   ;^)

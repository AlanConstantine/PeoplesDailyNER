	You know, John, if you had kept the follow-up to line here on talk
politics guns, we might have taken you a bit more seriously.  It would have
at least implied that you had some backbone, perhaps a modicum of willingness
to present your views and support them.  I guess we all know better now.

>People dumb enough to give their money and possessions to a guy who says he's
>jesus deserve all they get

	Really?  That's interesting, as I was always of the opinion that
people dumb enough to keep a monarchy around and support them with tax
funds when said monarchy is merely a figurehead deserve all that
they get.  Dunkirk, for example.  What?  That has nothing to do with it?
Then enjoy your helping of foot.

>Anyway, he killed a few feds

	And they killed a few people of their own, including one child
at last report.  So what?  Being a federal agent is not license to kill.
Then there's CNN indicating that the ATF/FBI actually *DID* start the
fires which would mean feds killed just under 100 people.  If you're
so hot to assign blame, make sure you don't overlook the obvious.

>He's not the goddam hero here

	Montgomery isn't much of a hero here, either.  Amazing how
different things look on the other side of the pond, isn't it?  Not
that what you think makes much of a difference in the USA, though, and
for good reason.  When you can vote I'll take your rhetoric a bit more
seriously.  Right now, you're merely a waste of trans-atlantic bandwidth.

>He's dead an' i'm happy!!!!!

	Proof positive that ignorance really is bliss.

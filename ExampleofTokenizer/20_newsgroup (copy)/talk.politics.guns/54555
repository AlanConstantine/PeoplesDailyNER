I leave the anti-semitism to anti-gun types like Holly Silva.  I have in

It is an outlaw agency run by incompetants who only have contempt for

I attribute the acts of the FBI to stupidity.  I attribute the acts of
the BATF to malice.  So did Senator Dennis DeConcini when he held
hearings about their misconduct.

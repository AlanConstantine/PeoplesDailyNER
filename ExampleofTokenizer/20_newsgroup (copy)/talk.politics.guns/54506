Why thanks for your reply to my post.  By the way, I never, never ever said 
that it was right to shoot "THOSE kind" of babies.  However it was the Branch
Davidian people in there that insisted on staying there with their "savior" 
(yeah right budy boy) because he had brain-washed them into believing that 
what ever he says is the truth, even if means that they are to give up their
lives for <<<<HIS>>>> cause.  Therefore it is Davids fault and not the ATF's
who gave them 50 to 51 days to get out, this was 50 days to many for me and
for many of the rest of the U.S.  I am however sad to hear of the death of any 
child unlike the sick bastard I supposedly am.

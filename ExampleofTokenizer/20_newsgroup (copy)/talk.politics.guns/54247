I have the April 15, 1993 issue of the SF Chronicle in my lap.  Page
E7 (in the "Sporting Green" section) has a Trader's advert.  (The
copy is a bit screwed up - it says that the prices offered expire
4-14-93, but the ad is there.)

The SF Examiner and Chronicle run the same set of adverts (because
they have a joint printing/biz agreement and differ only in editorial
content).

I've seen gun ads recently in the merc, which is anti-gun editorially,
albeit not from traders, but from its competitors.

I don't know about the other papers.

Does Traders claim that things are changing?  When?

>- Why TV journalists lie

Because it's easier than telling the truth and no one much cares
either way.

>Let me know if you write to any of these bozos.

Before you do, make sure that the bozos are actually doing what
you're accusing them of.

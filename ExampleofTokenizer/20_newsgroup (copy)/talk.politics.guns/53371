Not just because of the riflemen.  They also have many hard bunkers in
the mountains that would be nearly impossible to penetrate. As for
tanks, they would be rather useless in such mountainous terrain.

Gee, that's a new one.  He thought it was a different ethnic group.  
Since Hitler was determined to control, at the least, all of Europe,
do you think he gave a damn about international monetary concerns?  
Also, there's a LOT of gold in Swiss vaults.  Don't you think he new
that?  If he could have, he would have taken Switzerland.  However,
crazy as he was, he wasn't totally stupid.  It would have cost him a
hell of a lot to take Switzerland, with no guarantee that an invasion
would be successful.  He probably figured (or his generals did, when
he was listening to them) that it wasn't worth the cost.

Here's a copy of a letter I'm e-mailing to the Slickster at
his address of 75300.3115@compuserve.com:

____________________________________________________________________________

To: William J. Clinton
    President of the United States of America

Mr. President:

I am writing to express my utter outrage at the conduct of various
government agencies in regards to the tragedy in Waco.  I DEMAND
the dismissal or resignation of Lloyd Bensen, Secretary of the Treasury,
who bears responsibility for the initial helicopter and grenade attack 
by the ATF against the Branch Davidians, and of Janet Reno, who authorized 
the final assault on the very day that we were commemorating the Warsaw
ghetto revolt.  And I would truly appreciate it if you would make
sure something like this never happens again on your watch.

Respectfully yours,

Kenneth D. Whitehead

*   all we've gotten has been censored by the very people who have the   *
*   most to cover up.  And I'd REALLY like to know how they got the      *
*   press, who complained so loudly about being kept off the front lines *
*   during the Gulf War, be such obedient lap dogs in Waco...  Kind of   *
*   makes me wonder if this so-called "freedom of the press" isn't       *
*   highly overrated.                                                    *

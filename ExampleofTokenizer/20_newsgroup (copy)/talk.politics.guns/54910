Can you imagine what happens when a magazine explodes? Bullets go flying every
where. IMHO, these "gunshot wounds" were actually caused when the magazines 
went up. A Texas ranger does not a pathologist make, so I'll wait for an
autopsy to determine if they were shot first. 

Either way, they're all dead and the FBI & Atty. Gen. Vampria are still
responable.

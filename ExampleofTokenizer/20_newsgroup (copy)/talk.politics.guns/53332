As I recall, in the 60's the Kennedy Administration had sub-kiloton
nuclear weapons withdrawn from Europe and destroyed.  They were man-
portable and made for use in shoulder-mount rocket launchers.  The
smallest nuclear test I've seen data for was a .1 (yes, one-tenth)
kiloton weapon tested either in the late 40's or early 50's.

Here is a letter I sent to David Skaggs, (Dem, CO).  Before anybody says
something, yes the letter is a bit "sharp" in tone.  I have been writting
reasonable and polite letters to him for years, and all I get in return
in the HCI party line.  Since he already is NRA F rated, I don't think that
upsetting him will harm the cause.  Sorry if you disagree, but recent events
in Texas REALLY have me pissed.

Representative Skaggs,

Recently I wrote to you regarding my outrage over the tactics used by the
Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, (BATF), in Texas.  In your response
you stated that "Events in Texas underscore the need for stricter gun control
legislation to keep guns out of the hand of groups such as the Branch Davidians.
My question to you is, "what grounds would you use to deny them access to 
firearms?"  Best I can tell this statement underscores your apparent total
ignorance of the subject, and highlights your personal bias against firearms.
I say this because there are only two possible paths of "gun control" which you
could have been referencing.

Either:
1) You were talking about their access to semi-automatics firearms.  In this
case I should point out that semi-automatic firearms are legal in most areas of
this Country, including Texas and Colorado.  In addition the members of the
"cult" have never been convicted of any crimes which would deny them the ability
to purchase these weapons.  So under what grounds would you deny them these
guns?  Their religion?  The fact they they live in a large group alone by
themselves?  Because you consider them to be a cult?  Maybe I consider your
Church to be a cult!

This line of reasoning by you borders on the concept of "thought crimes."  You
and Pat Robertson should really get along.

2) You were referring to the ALLEGED FULLY automatic weapons possessed by the
"cult."  Under current US law, FULLY automatic weapons have been covered by
some of the strictest gun control laws in this Nation.  So if David Koresh
illegally possessed them, he would have had to circumvent some of the strictest
laws we have.  How will more laws help?  By the way, it has been reported that
David Koresh possessed a Federal Firearms License which would have permitted 
him to possess FULLY automatic weapons.  If true, the 85 people who perished
Monday in the fire, died so that the Federal government could collect a couple
hundred dollars in taxes on guns David Koresh didn't declare.

I have heard claims that they were "stockpiling weapons."  Yet considering the
number of people in the complex, even 200+ weapons would not have been out of
line with gun ownership statistics for all of Texas.  What's next?  A siege of
Dallas/Ft Worth for alleged "stockpiling?"

Face it David Skaggs, You have voted for virtually EVERY gun control law that
has passed through Congress, yet you claim that you are only for "reasonable"
restrictions.  Bull****!   Handgun Control Inc. is struggling to maintain
250,000 PAID members, while the NRA has just exceeded 3,000,000 members.  They
are still growing at a rate of 2,000 new members per day.  Driving around YOUR
district I see NRA stickers every day.  In eight plus years of living here I
have only seen ONE HCI bumper sticker.  When you vote for your "reasonable"
gun control laws, are you really representing your district, or are you
representing Sarah Bradys'?


					Thank You,

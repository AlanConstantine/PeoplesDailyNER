Ludicrous, huh?

 HEAVILY ARMED RELIGIOUS CULT BATTLES GOVERNMENT

 Troops have been called out after a skirmish involving government
 officials and a religious cult which has been gathering weapons in their
 "private city".

 The cult's leaders, who claim that God speaks to them, have told cult
 members to arm themselves in preparation for the end of the world, which
 they believe to me imminent.

 Weapons believed to be in their possession include large-bore military
 weapons as well as sporting arms.  A recent series in nearby newspapers
 has exposed the plans of the cult to take power throughout the region.

 Troops have surrounded the cult's "city" after incidents in which
 officials have exchanged shots with cult members.  There have been
 reports of children being seen in the cult compound, where discipline is
 said to be strictly administered.

 Governor Liliburn Boggs has issued an order that these "Mormons" are to
 be exterminated, or driven from the state..

Since the jury's not yet in on exactly how the fire REALLY started, the
only dead children here for whom blame can be proven at the moment were 
the ones shot by government fire.

A citizen has the right to stop ANY attacking criminal -- even one with 
a uniform.  Clothing aside, you know, it's still not legal to serve a
search warrant with a concussion grenade.

Well then, find out.

By the way, this is not a claim of "Koresh's folks," it is a claim of 
the government -- the same government which DID have grenades and grenade
launchers and DID use them.  No one has seen ANY evidence of the BD's 
having, much less using, such weaponry.  If they were stocking such things 
against Armageddon, why would they have left them in the boxes when 
Armageddon actually arrived?

See above, for one example.  The "abuses" involved were non-mainstream 
religious beliefs, polygamy, child abuse, and fortification.  Sound
familiar?  In my opinion, the BD's were as much a real threat to society
as the Mormons were then or are now.  (That is, until they were provoked.)

By the way, I find your statement about "non-Nazi" law ironic.  Koresh was 
suspected of violating the Gun Control Act of 1968, which was BASED ON the
text of the Nazi Weapons Law of March 18, 1938.  ("Gun Control's Nazi 
Connection;" Jews for Preservation of Firearms Ownership, 2872 S. 
Wentworth Ave., Milwaukee, WI 53207, (414) 769-0760.)

By the way, what was Koresh's specific violation?  FAILURE TO PAY A TAX.
That's right -- the BATF are TREASURY agents.  Did a failure to pay a
$200/gun tax really justify armed attack, night torture, and ultimately
the death penalty?

No -- think for yourself, for once.

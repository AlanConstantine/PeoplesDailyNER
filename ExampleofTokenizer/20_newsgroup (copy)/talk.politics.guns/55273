I think this is a little extreme, i am concerned about a couple of things
i've seen lately. It seems to me that the government is *beginning* to 
enforce political correctness. the first King verdict was polically incorrect
so the hell with constutitional protection from double jeopardy, try the cops
again. the BD's are far as i can tell didn't do anything wrong. nothing that
would justify the horrable end they were subjected too. they were simply
polically incorrect in the extream. i can't help but wonder "who's next"

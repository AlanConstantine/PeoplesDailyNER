}       Do they teach courses in rude in Canada?

They don't have too.  Canadian culture is handed down largely from the United
Empire Loyalists who fled from the American Revolution.  Canuckleheads tend
to have a "cratophilic," or government-loving attitude towards authority.

Paul Prescod is right in line with this elitist bigotry and prejudice that
all my Canadian friends hate in their fellow citizens.  His sort of snobbish
Canuck have an irrational horror of American democratic "armed mobs."

I have not made up my mind about Waco, but there sure seems to be a group of  
devoted government following fanatics willing to believe whatever that  
government wants to tell them, without any shred of doubt, nor thought of thier  
own.  They sure get shrill whenever their belief structure is being shaken.

Kinda reminds you of the BDs, doesn't it?

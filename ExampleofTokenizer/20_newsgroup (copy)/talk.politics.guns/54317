And everybody who talked about the evil arising in Europe was labeled 
reactionary in the late 1930's... after all, we could negotiate with Hitler and
trust him to keep his end of the bargain... at least that's what Stalin and
Chamberlin thought... I guess they forgot to teach you about your country being
overrun by the Germans in WWII, 'eh Thomas?  And I'm sorry you consider outrage
at government excesses to be ####... Everytime the Israelis conduct a mass 
operation against a terrorist group that is actively killing their citizens and
soldiers, the world gets indignant, but it's ok for the US to assault it's own
citizens who were a religous minority and accused of sexual deviation and 
hoarding weapons... I find it real ironic this happened the same day Al Gore
arrived in Poland to recognize the sacrifices made in the Warsaw Ghetto where
the same 'justifications' were raised for an armed assault by black-clad troops
with armor support...

In Texas, you cannot carry a handgun.  Period.  Either concealed or open.
And your numbers are misleading; they include suicides and accidents.  The
real number from the Department of Public Safety:

                   Murders, Non-neg hom		Car fatalities
1991			2651			  3079
1992			2240			  3057

Texas only has "liberal" gun laws as far as purchasing a firearm; aside 
from that, it's probably more restrictive than most states as far as carry
goes.

The state was Virginia, and the law passed.

That right only inflicts on those who threaten my rights to life,
liberty, the pursuit of happiness, etc., in the first place.  I am not
a criminal, and I don't indiscriminately fire my weapons at random.  
So please explain how I am "inflicting" anything on other people.

Does anybody have any solid data on how many legally owned versus
illegally owned firearms are used in crime.  I know the number of
legally owned guns used in crime is small, but I would like a number,
and a reference if possible.

Data should be e-mailed to me.
Open discussion should be directed to talk.politics.guns

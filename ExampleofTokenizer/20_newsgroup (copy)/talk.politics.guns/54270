ACLU Official Policies.

Policy 18, for example, opposes rating systems for motion
pictures: "Industry sponsored ratings systems create the
potential for constraining the creative process and thus
contracting the marketplace of ideas. Despite the stated goal of
providing guidance to parents, experience has shown that ratings
inevitably have serious chilling effects on freedom of
expression."

In regards to the Pledge of Allegiance, the ACLU states in its
Policy 84: "The insertion of the words `under God' into the
Pledge of Allegiance is a violation of the constitutional
principle of separation of Church and State."

Policy 120 states that, "Military conscription under any
circumstances is a violation of civil liberties and
constitutional guarantees." The ACLU objects to the draft even
during wartime because of the "anti-democratic power it gives
government to wage war without support of the people."

Policy 125 states, "The ACLU calls for a broad-based inquiry into
war crimes within the widest possible definition of war crimes
against humanity, and crimes against the peace, focusing upon the
actions of the United States military and other combatants
against the people of South Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and North
Vietnam."

Policy 133 states, "The ACLU recognizes that US government
reliance upon nuclear weaponry as a dominant element of foreign
and domestic policy, while propounded as a defense of democracy,
is in fact a great threat to civil liberties. Four decades of
adherence to this policy has fundamentally altered the nature of
our constitutional democratic process and poses a paramount
threat to our civil liberties."

Policy 217 objects to roadblocks "where drivers are stopped for
sobriety tests" because they "violate Fourth Amendment
principles." 

Policy 242 states the following on criminal
sentencing: "The most appropriate correctional approach is
reintegrating the offender into the community, and the goals of
reintegration are furthered much more readily by working with the
offender within the community than by incarceration. Probation
should be authorized by the legislature in every case; exceptions
to the principle are not favored, and any exceptions, if made,
should be limited to the most serious of offenses, such as murder
or treason."

As I understand it was considered unsafe for the tv networks to get
any closer. Surely the networks can judge the risks of reporting
for themselves. I haven't noticed CNN being banned from Baghdad
hotels yet despite the (all too real) risk of having a cruise
missile land in the lobby. Incidentally has that ever been explained
or are we to assume that out of the whole of the city an off-course
missile just happened to hit that hotel at a probability of about
1 in some very large number?

Unsafe for who I wonder?

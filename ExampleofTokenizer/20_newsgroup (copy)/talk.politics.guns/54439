Only irrational fools such as yourself are set against RKBA.  There are
*plenty* of people who support it.

The government will be overthrown *long* before that happens.  A *huge* 
millitia composed of all available men and women who care about their
country will defeat the forces of the evil Klintonistas.  The people
*will* prevail!

Oh, so you think armed citizens alone can't overthrow the government?
Consider this:  do you think *all* law enforcement officials and members
of the Armed Forces will turn against the people that they are entrusted
to serve?  Not hardly.  You can count on a lot of people in the Army,
Marines, Air Force, Navy, National Guard, police officers, and so on
joining in the cause to defend the liberties and freedoms of American
citizens.  COUNT ON IT!  THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DISARM
EVERYONE WITHOUT STARTING A CIVIL WAR!

Wrong again.  People will just hide their guns so these "officers"
(more like jack-booted stormtroopers) will not be able to find them.

They will unless they are idiots.  They will realize that if they don't
then they will be *next* including you.  Believe me if what you describe
happens they will be coming for *more* than guns.  Disarming citizens
would require that everyone's cherished freedoms and liberties be
suspended temporarily.  More likely, they'd never be restored unless the
*people* do something about it.

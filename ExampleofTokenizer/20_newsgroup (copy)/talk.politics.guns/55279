Will do! I appreciate the thoughtfullness of the Post to not be an
intermediary for such sales. The "Right to bear arms" is one of the most
misapplied rights in our Constitution, and assault weapons go way beyond
what is, or rather should be (imho), a "natural" right in America. Just
ask the family of that boy shot back in September - the papers are full of
stories about a child with an assult weapon with a "angelic face" (Post)
who committed the murder without ever thinking.
 
This has all got to get under control. I applaud the Post for their bravery

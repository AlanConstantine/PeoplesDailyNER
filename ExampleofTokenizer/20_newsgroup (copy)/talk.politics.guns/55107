This would have to be a call.  You are not required to say anything until you
have a lawyer present, and not saying anything until such time is not to be
construed as derogatory to your cause.  Anything you DO say can later be used
against you.  You will be talking to the police, the same people who will be
gathering evidence for the prosecutor to use against you.

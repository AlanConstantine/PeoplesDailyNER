Let's discuss Reno's taking full responciblity. Is everyone happy with the 
outcome? Did the FBI pursue the correct course of action? was justice done?
If Reno really meant what she said she would resign! She is just grand
standing, period. What did those people do wrong in the first place? that is
what i can't figure out. sure they were crazy, no dought about it, but what did 
they do wrong? someone please help me out on this.

Yeah.  We don't want to spend too much money preserving lives, after
all.  Escpecially when they're all just a bunch of crazy fanatic
cultists anyway, instead of normal people.

[The above is supposed to be dripping with sarcasm, but I'm too burned
out right now (get it? "burned out" ha ha!) to tell if it's working.
Look, folks, what David Koresh and his followers were was _broken_.  It
takes a certain amount of flexibility and insanity to survive in this
world and they didn't have enough of it and that wasn't their fault.  So
please stop dancing on their graves, okay?]

I'd appreciate any help anyone could give me on these two questions:
 
The Brady Bill was in the news throughout 1992 but what actually happened to
it in Congress?  Did Bush veto it?  If so, when?
 
Also, the state of Virginia, I believe, just passed a gun control bill on
Febrauary 25 of this year.  I think it limits gun purchases to one a month -
is this correct?  What was the bill number?
 
Anyone?

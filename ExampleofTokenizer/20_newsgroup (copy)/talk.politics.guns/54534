I don't remember the figures EXACTLY, but there were about 3500 deaths in Texas
in 1991 that was caused by guns.....
This is more than those beeing killed in car-ACCIDENTS!
(Yes, there could be that low sentences or high poverty could influence the
figures but they're still *pretty* high right??)
I also believe Texas has some of the most liberal 'gun-laws' in USA......


*I* should not suffer because of others....
We all agree on this one, BUT we also live in a sociaty and therefor
we'll have to give up *SOME* of our 'freedom' (Note the '').

Do you have an insurance??
Then you'll have to pay because of what others do...

Do you buy anything??
YOU are paying for those who return goods, steal or even those who gets a bonus...

Do you live with other people??
Then you 'can't' do ererything you'd want (burping/farting playing music LOUD)

-What the hell is he trying to say ??
When you live in a society (USA are stilll counted as one...) you
have to saccrifice.
The question is HOW MUCH.


One state (don't remember which, Texas??) tried to impose a rule that you could
only buy ONE gun each MONTH. Think you all know what happened.....

I respect the right to defend yourself, but that right should not inflict on
other people.

It seems like you all realize that you have a problem in America, the only
problem is
that you won't take the car away from the drunk driver, you hope to cure him
first.

Hope life comfirms to the standard of Winnie the Poh.

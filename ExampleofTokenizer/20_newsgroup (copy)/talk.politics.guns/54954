I'm not expert on Christianity, but I know a little about history
and how the repeated instances of Messianic figures (jesus was neither
the first, last nor most serious of those pretenders) related
to the history of the period.

A messiah in those days was to bring salvation from the Romans!
He was supposed to reclaim Israel and Judaea, bring the Israelites
back from what is now Iraq-Persia-Afghanistan, and do so
not only by faith, but by real war.  Any Messianic pretender
would tell his followers to get ready for war, since they
were going to throw the Romans out of Judaea and free the
Israelites.

For those interested, Bar Kochba's claim was taken far more
seriously than Jesus' among the Jews.  They revolted and
600,000 were slaughtered by the Romans.  His claim was only
rejected after his defeat, although for a short time he looked
as though he would win.  They even got to mint coins before
the Romans triumphed.

Now how that has played into Christianity is rather interesting
given your use of the statement attributed to Jesus.  Did Koresh
figure he had to get rid of the US government to free Israel?
Had he the foggiest notion of who are todays descendants of
the Israelites? (one hint, almost none of them are Christians,
look at the three countries listed above, they were their
and Jewish until at least the 10th century)

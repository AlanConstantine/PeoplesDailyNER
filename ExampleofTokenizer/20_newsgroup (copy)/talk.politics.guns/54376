I don't sign any blank checks.

When Doug Foxvog says "weapons of mass destruction," he means CBW and
nukes.  When Sarah Brady says "weapons of mass destruction" she means
Street Sweeper shotguns and semi-automatic SKS rifles.  When John
Lawrence Rutledge says "weapons of mass destruction," and then immediately
follows it with:

   Hitler invaded Yugoslavia and occupied it.  The mountainous portions were
sometimes patrolled by the wermacht, but they were certainly not in control.
There were two major native factions opposing each other and the germans,
It was basically useless to the germans (no production) and a drain on their
resources (a armored division and a couple of infantry divisions) Which if
my memory is correct, were kind of stuck there up until the allies accepted
their surrender.  (I think that the allies also let the germans keep some 
of their weapons for self defense unitil they were able to get to the 
lowlands, away from the resistance factions.  This is from memory, and 
it is unreliable.

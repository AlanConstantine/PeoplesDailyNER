  Correct.  You'd have to be very unfamiliar with US history to 
  think that we have substantially fewer rights today than in 
  in 1932.  The police could generally get away with a lot more
  in those days, there were few citizens and media "watchdog" 
  organizations, no "Miranda" rulings, and women, blacks, gays,
  and other such groups had very few right indeed.  Moreover
  censorship of media and similar artistic expression was rampant
  at that time (think about "banned in Boston" or the Hays
  Commission).  

  My comments were directed against those who see these sorts
  of incidents as proof that rights as we know them are about to 
  vanish.

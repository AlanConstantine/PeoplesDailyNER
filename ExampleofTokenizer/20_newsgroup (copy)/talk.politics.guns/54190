      Not provable.  It's about as "provable" as the number of votes
vast for Bill Clinton in the last election.  If you accept the information
available, you can prove one way or the other.  If you refuse to accept
it, nothing is "provable."

      Fine, support your assertation.  But, you haven't supported
any assertations just yet.

      The National Crime Survey, that secret Arm of the NRA, estimates
between 40,000 and 50,000 with-gun self-defenses from assaults, and
is considered to considerably under-report.  When broken down by weapon,
there is no form of "self-defense" including dowing nothing which is
more effective at avoiding injury or death.

      Ok, support *this* assertation.  Hell, support *one*.

>Too much of this has ruined you cause. There is no recovery. 

      That's nice.

>In the near future, federal martials will come for your arms.

      That's nice, too.

>The 2nd amendment is dead. Accept this. Find another way.

       Why on Earth should we?  If you're correct we've nothing to
lose by continuing to argue against it and everything to gain.

That includes suicides.  Since it has been shown in other countries that
suicide rates are pretty much independent of the means available for
doing oneself in (studies include some done/published in Japan, Canada,
Austria, Norway), suicides ought not be included in the count.

If this is done, the number of vehicle-related deaths greatly exceeds that
of firearms-related deaths in Texas.

>*I* should not suffer because of others....

Certainly not.

Why?  Unless it's doing something that directly hurts someone else, what's
the point?  (Otherwise, you'd better stop operating all motor vehicles, since
the price of operating them *greatly* exceeds the cost in lives of firearms.

WEll, it's been done at least twice.  South (North?) Carolina did it a few
years back...and watched its crime rate relative to the rest of the country
rise quite a bit.

Virginia just passed the law...no word yet on what the results will be, but
I'd be willing ot bet that a reduction in crime rates won't be one of them.

Self-defense doesn't "inflict" on other people (except perhaps the criminal
who's tried to do you damage, and maybe indirectly on future potential victims
who might not become victims).

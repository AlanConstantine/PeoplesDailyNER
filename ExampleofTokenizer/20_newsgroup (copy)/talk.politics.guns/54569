The following is quoted from the tail end of a (rather condescending)
article about Paxton Quigley, that appeared in US Snooze and World Lies,
(sorry... i think it was in the wall street journal...)
and was repeated in the Colorado (people's) Daily, a student newspaper
at the University of Colorado at Boulder.

"A study of residential gunsot deaths in King County, Wash., found that
a gun in the home was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner,
spouse, a friend, or child than to kill an intruder.  Studies by the 
Western Psychiatric Institute, in Pittsburgh, found that the mere presence
of a gun in the home sharply incresases the likelihood a family member
will commit suicide, even in the absence of psychiatric illness."

I have seen these numbers quoted before, and I have seen very specific
refutation of them quoted as well.  If someone will be so kind as to
email the relevant information, I will write a letter to the editor of
the Co. Daily (which might get published) and send a copy to USN&WR as
well.

Thanx...

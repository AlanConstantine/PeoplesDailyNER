No, Lt Calley was later acquitted. His troops killed 400-500
people, including kids, elderly and women... I sure don't want
to see the domestic law enforcement agencies in this country
adhere to those "military standards"... If they did, we're
all in big trouble...(The My Lai massacre was covered up
by high-ranking officials and ALL who were involved were
ACQUITTED).

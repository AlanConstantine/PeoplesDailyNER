I want this man to tell me how in the hell you can take the 
explosives used in the WTC bombing, considering that the 
consensus seems to be that the explosive was a fertilizer-based
one.  Ammonium nitrate, to be exact . . . of which about
90,000 tons disappears per year (if I recall the stat correctly;
I don't have it here.)  Just one more disregarding of reality
to push a point.

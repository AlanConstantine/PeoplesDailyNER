 Well I don't want my tax dollars going to that kind of philosophy. 
 maybe if the good folks you are talking about are people like you 
 than I might be inclined to accept it. What does the batf do anyway? 
 Why don't we have a bureau for militant, paranoid, freedom killers 
 like yourself. People like you are more dangerous than alcohol, 
 tobacco and firearms.

 Maybe we should just have nuked the whole city, I mean, what's a 
 100,000 good souls anyway? 
 Get real, you sound like a racist.  I guess life isn't so precious 
 to you, do you realize that there were  24 children KILLED!!! 
 They will never get to fall in love, they won't see another sunrise, 
 no prom, no first date, no football, baseball no NOTHING.  Why doesn't 
 some people think first before they let everyone know how narrow they 
 are.

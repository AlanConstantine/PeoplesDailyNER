	For the record, it wasn't until I came to college (excluding
the times I went to Omaha or Council Bluffs for something) that I
ever removed the keys from the ignition of my car!  Come to think of
it, it was only after I moved to Ames, Ia (pop 45K) that I ever took
to locking my doors at night.

	I've discovered that $50K/year isn't worth living in fear
all day.  I might just move back to the farm.

	This weekend is Veishea.  You know, when ISU students riot
for no apparent reason.  This year, we've the Farm Aid concert
to add to the festivities.  Anybody bet me there's another riot?
Remember, Iowa law has three guys talking loud defined as a riot.
Stay tuned for an on-the-scene report this weekend.

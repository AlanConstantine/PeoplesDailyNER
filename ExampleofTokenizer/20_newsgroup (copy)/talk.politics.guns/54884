After seeing William Sessions on television, explaining the great lengths
to which the FBI went to determine the suicidal tendancies of David Koresh, 
I got the very unpleasent feeling that Koresh had manipulated the FBI's 
perceptions much the way he manipulated his own followers.

Maybe I was manipulated by the news story.

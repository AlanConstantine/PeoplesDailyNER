Kind of sounds like Plessy v. Ferguson, huh?  Of course as in that case,
things change, huh?

No, if your little fantasy comes to pass, the country will have gone
TOWARD the KKK.  You're of course being a little disengenuous.  Violent
solutions are never passe FOR THE GOVERNMENT and CRIMINALS (who frequently)
cannot be distinguished).

"Avoid situations which encourage criminals"?  You mean don't be a woman?
Don't be Black?  Don't be gay?  I'm quite certain that having a surfeit of
unarmed victims will discourage your beloved KKK from engaging in "violent
solutions"....

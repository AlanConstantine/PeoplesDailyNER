In the videos of the original BATF attack on the BD church, did anyone
happen to see BATF agents on the highest structure, where Koresh's
room was? I don't recall seeing BATF agents higher than the roof of the
lowest structures, so I made an assumption that BATF helos did the
firing down into the tower. Any other info on how the rounds came
through the roof?

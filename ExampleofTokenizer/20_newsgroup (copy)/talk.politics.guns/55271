I made a few phone calls today, and found that if you call the Bill Room at
the Sacramento State Capitol, you may order free of charge any bills that
are currently being pushed.  I was told that they will only fill an order of
five bills per phone call, but when I asked kindly and told the nice lady that
it was very important, she filled my order for ten.

California State Bill Room
916-445-2323

My thanks to Bob Hale for providing the bill numbers!

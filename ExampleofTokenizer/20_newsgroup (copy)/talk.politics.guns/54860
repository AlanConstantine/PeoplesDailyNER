     So could the defenders in the Alamo.  You're clearly missing the
     point here.  Typically, I might add.

     If it were me, I doubt that *I* would have come out.

     BATF show up, start shooting at me, etc.  Then they paint me
     a child-molesting murdering fanatic, call up TANKS, hundreds
     of automatic-armed goons.  Restrict press access to two miles
     away.  

     Come on.  If I can watch pictures of burned women and children
     in Bosnia on CNN, why am I being limited to a two-mile-away
     replay of a fire in Waco?  Huh?  Answer me that.

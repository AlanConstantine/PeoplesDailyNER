  And another one:

Hasn't enyone heard of a leader's recon?  This is when the leader of the
assult goes and looks at the objective to see if anything has changed that
would affect the mission.  Even the Freshman cadets here in ROTCland
know about them.  Mostly because they know it as the part where they 
lie on the cold ground for an hour or so, but they've heard about it.
Maybe the ATF should have hired out to the local ROTC guys!

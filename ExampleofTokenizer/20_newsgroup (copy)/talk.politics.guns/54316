When will you people realize that our right to keep and bear isn't
primarily intended to be for protecting against criminals and beasties
in the wild?  Granted, it is a big part, but we also need military style
weapons so we can fight off the government when they come to our door.
When ten agents come to my door, it would be nice to be able to shoot
all of them for 'not upholding the constitution to the best of their
ability'.  It will be a lot harder doing that with the puny weapons you
listed above.

Please read the Federalist papers for all clarification on RKBA.  These
documents have cleared up plenty of misnomers that friends of mine have
had.

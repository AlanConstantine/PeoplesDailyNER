	OK ... a near-majority actually OWN firearms, but I will still
	claim that the VAST majority never needs to use them or even
	threaten anyone with them. What do they do right ... or are
	they just lucky ? In either case, this means the 'average

	I think you have weapons on the brain. I never said that these
	alternative means of self-protection involved any hardware.
	Why are 'good' neighborhoods 'good' ? It isn't because every
	person is armed to the teeth. It is because of (1) attitude
	and (2) cooperation. In the 'good' neighborhoods, the residents
	make themselves aware of their neighbors and notice when
	strangers are lurking around. 'Good' neighborhoods form groups
	like 'crime-watch' to increase this effect, and the relative
	effectiveness of the police. When hostiles are arrested, the
	good neighbors step up and say "THAT'S the one officer ! He
	was robbing Mr. Jones' house". 

	In short, the alternative to firepower is gangs ... or at
	least a benificent manifestation of that social cooperative.
	Replace lead with flesh ... the flesh makes a better
	conversationalist too and you can invite it over for a
	block party.

	Oliver North. The man is positively worshiped in many
	all-American 'conservative' quarters. He and Big Ron
	set-up a secret government and did all sorts of severely
	illegal deeds - the kind of stuff you and I would be doing
	twenty-to-life for, yet he walks free. This BS happens all
	the time. In fact, it happens so much that no one really
	cares anymore.  'Legitimacy' is a non-issue. Legality is
	a non-issue. So long as we get T-bones and our MTV, who
	gives a rats ass ?

	No. I claimed that no one is interested in the statistical
	aspects of the argument. Pure emotion, like the abortion issue.

	Argue away ... you can't win.

	Firearms-related mindless mayhem will be related to the
	availibility of firearms. If they become scarce and 
	and expensive, a different psychology will take hold.
	I *think* they would be used far less to settle trivial
	complaints.

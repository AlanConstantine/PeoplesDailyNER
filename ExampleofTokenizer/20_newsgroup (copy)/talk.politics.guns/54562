On a DA revolver, you get another try on a misfire.  On a pistol where
the trigger does not cock the hammer, like a Jennings, or an Astra M400,
or a Glock, a misfire requires the slide be cycled to get the gun  to
function.

Rather than a high capacity revolver, think of a Glock as an Astra M400 
with no manual safety and a heavier trigger pull.

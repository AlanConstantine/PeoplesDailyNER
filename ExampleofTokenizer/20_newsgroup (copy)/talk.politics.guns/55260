       The Brady Bill passed the House in 1992, but failed to reach a
vote in the Senate.  As such, it never reached Bush.  (Sarah Brady's
condemnation not-withstanding).
 
       It'll probably pass the House again, and will probably pass the
Senate if they can get it to a vote.  Whether of not they'll be busy
with other things will be the question.  I don't expect gung-ho opposition
on the part of Senate Republicans, since they won't want to over-use their
fillibuster trump card.

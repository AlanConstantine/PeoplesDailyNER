With one exception, that's a pretty good description of many of the
Baptists I know.  The exception is that they know the difference
between an M-16 and an AR-15.  Heck - they even know that "it looks
like Richard Petty's stock car" doesn't mean "it's a racing stock
car".  They may be uncouth, but they've figured out that appearance
isn't function.

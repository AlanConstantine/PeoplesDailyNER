I don't think your objection is beyond the bounds of rationality.  The
right mentioned in the bill is already established under the Second
Amendment; the bill should be reworded to reaffirm the Second Amendment
RKBA, and then establish the procedures for redress through the federal
court system.

The right already exists and is already embodied in our Constitution.

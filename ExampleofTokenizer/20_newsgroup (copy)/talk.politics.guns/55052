	I'd bet cash 90% of the people couldn't find the window after six
minutes!  Ask anybody who's taken basic training in the military.  It is
not at all uncommon for a few soldiers who have not properly attached
and cleared their masks to require assistance exiting the chamber.  Since
that chamber has a door, not just a window, it's likely a hell of a lot
easier to exit than a multi-room, damaged house.

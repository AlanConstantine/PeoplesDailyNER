Give me a break.  If the Mormons fortified Utah and armed it to the teeth,
and were involved in illegal activity, then they deserve whatever they get.

You are making a ludicrous suggestion.

Does that include the right to murder little children?  How about killing
ATF officers?  I do not know much about the gun laws in Texas, but 
Koresh's folks claimed to have grenades, grenade launchers, and rocket
launchers.  I am not sure that the NRA feels that this falls under 
"right to bear arms."

Please explain.  I do not remember Jews or Mormons (as a group) overtly 
breaking a judicious (a.k.a. non-Nazi) law and being punished for it.

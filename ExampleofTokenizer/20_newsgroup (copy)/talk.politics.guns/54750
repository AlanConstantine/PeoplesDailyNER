I don't recall saying Baptists do any of that.  Though I suppose some do.  And  
none of them are listed in the dictionary as characteristics of a cult.  My  
mother stockpiled Campbells soup when it was on sale.

constitution, which was formed in part to protect religious cults which had  
been persecuted in England before migrating here to be free.  You are the one  
endangering our constitution.

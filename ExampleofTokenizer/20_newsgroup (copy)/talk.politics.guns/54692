Well let's see Miranda is out now so you can't claim that one.  '32 was 
before we got the 1938 NAZI Gun Law revisited as the 1968 Gun control
Laws. Not to mention all the others that have followwed it.  In '32 we
didn't have the Federal policy allowing Law Enforcement to seize property
and sell it or otherwise use it themselves without convictions.  Shall
we go on or is that a clear enough start.

PLAIN OLD JOE

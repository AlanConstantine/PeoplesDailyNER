The Swiss population is (and well was) far larger than that. I think
your question should be, "...losing sleep over a million expert
riflemen?" Certainly he could have conquered Switzerland, but
a million armed militiamen (especially in a mountainous area, 
where tanks' effectiveness is limited) would have made it a
real pain. The question a conqueror would ask, is "is it worth 
the trouble?" The more difficult an invasion is, the more likely
the answer would be "no." Certainly a million riflemen (as
opposed to a professional army of only ten or twenty thousand, the
best a country the size of Switzerland could support), makes
invasions more difficult.

Really? In 1939? I'm not even sure you could prove that today (despite
the steriotype.) Certainly the Swiss bankers were not essential
to the German war-time economy.

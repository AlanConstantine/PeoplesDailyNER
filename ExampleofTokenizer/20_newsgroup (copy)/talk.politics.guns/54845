Wait a minute.  The story being pushed here is that the fire started
in ONE PLACE.  This is not consistent with the story that they were
TRAPPED by the fire (particularly in a building that all of a sudden
had many more exits).

Well, for everyone besides Koresh and his blood children, we can 
assume independent choice: Ah, they chose to stay in the face of
an assault which clearly endangered their lives.  Or, alternatively,
they were not permitted to leave.  Choose one.

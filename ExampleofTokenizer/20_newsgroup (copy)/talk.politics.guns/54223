You "think" wrong.  Ask the FBI.  They've got the proof.  Look it up.

You lie like a snake.  The "vast majority" of the 200 MILLION firearms
in this country are never used in anger.  Your feelings notwithstanding.

:Too much of this has ruined you cause. There is no recovery. 
:In the near future, federal martials will come for your arms.
:No one will help you. You are more dangerous, to their thinking,
:than the 'criminal'. This is your own fault. 

We will overcome the kind of blind, pig-headed, utterly stupid idiocy that
you and others spout in a vain attempt to further your own agendas.  We
will make the truth be known, despite your best efforts to the contrary.

:The 2nd amendment is dead. Accept this. Find another way.

The Second Amendment won't be dead unless it is repealed.  That won't happen.

EVER.

Accept this.  Find another way to try and control other's lives, because we
see you for what you are, and we are not fooled.

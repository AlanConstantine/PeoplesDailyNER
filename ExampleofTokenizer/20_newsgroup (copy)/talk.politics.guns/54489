And who is responsible for it not happening?
Certainly not the children.  Koresh was calling the shots.  He was 
talking with his lawyer and the FBI.  Since others were released safely, 
there is no sane reason for keeping the children inside the compound.

Not at all.  Are you a Koresh worshiper?

Thanks for my laugh of the day!  Definitely a very silly supposition.

I would if I could.  The news show that showed the lengthy excerpts also 
had interviews with the filmmaker who made the documentary who basically 
confirmed what was shown in the excerpts from the time he spent at the 
compound in 1992.

I believe that this was reported by local radio reporters on site.
A fire started in a three story tower at the same time as the two 
story window shown on the tv coverage.

I thought about mentioning how Reagan and the military treated the press 
in Grenada and how that set the precedent, but decided it wasn't worthy 
of discussion.  If the news reporter got shot, you can bet his family 
would sue the government for letting him into the danger area.

The root cause of suspicion in my mind is why 100 people wouldn't flee 
a building that had numerous exits during the 30 minutes time it took 
to burn down.  Or why didn't they flee hours earlier when the tear gas was 
first introduced?  I can find no rational explanation for their behavior.

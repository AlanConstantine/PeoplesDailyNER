And Bejing = Peking, who cares about native tongue, as long as we all  
understand each other.

Oh, not more than a few feet, I wouldn't think.  I'm sorry IF your paternal  
grandparents died in Oswiecym or Aushwitz, which is easier to say than prove,  
but if so, the lesson they paid thier lives for was wasted on you.

You are the expert.  I often feel compelled to brag about the circumstances of  
my grandparent's death.  8-}

A BATF offense, if true.

A LOCAL offense, if true.  Totally outside the BATF's domain.

I didn't know the man.  Just what the TV chose to tell me.

I thought there were prejudicial undertones here.  I would trust my daughter's  
judgement.

I don't believe either side blindly.

IF they fired first, without announcing in a beleivable way who they were ( I  
can pound on your door and claim to be the police, will you just lay down and  
take it if I do?), then he could be justified in firing on the ATF in  
self-defense.

"His background"?  What law has he been convicted of breaking in the past?

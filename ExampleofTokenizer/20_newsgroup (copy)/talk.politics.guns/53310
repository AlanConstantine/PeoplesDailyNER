For those of you interested, I just finished talking with a 
representative of Senator Bob Krueger's reelection campaign about his 
position on the RTKBA.  Krueger was appointed by the  Democratic Governor 
of Texas to complete Lloyd Bentsen's unexpired term.

The representative said that Senator Krueger did not have a position and 
would only comment on specific legislation that was pending.  No comment 
was available on the various versions of the Brady Bill.

Be warned and vote accordingly.

The BATF is a part of the dept. of treasury, not justice.  If they needed
to assault a place they could just do like the IRS does...call in the
federal marshalls service, their fugitive collection teams do similar type
assaults all the time.  And they are very, very good about it, in both the
tactical and legal parts of it.  But I suspect that the marshalls would
not have touched it, because the search warrant (which is still sealed I
believe) was so bogus.  

Besides the BATF also could have gotton SWAT teams from: federal marshalls
service; FBI; secret service; national park service; texas rangers; nearby
large city police forces; the military.  But they had to use their own
guys, nobody elses SWAT team was good enough for the holy cause of gun
control.   

	I also find the timing of the raid to be extremely interesting. 
Initial raid: two days before the NJ senate was going to overturn their
"assault weapon" confiscation law; a couple weeks before the BATF's budget
was going to come up in congress for review;  shortly after Reno got
confirmed as AG (I don't need to remind you about her anti-gun line);
right around the presidents 100th day in office.   As a wise man once
said: once is happenstance, twice is coincidence, three times is enemy
action.    I don't believe that these four things are conincidental.  Do
you?  


food for thought...

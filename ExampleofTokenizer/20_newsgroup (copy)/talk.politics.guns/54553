Good - now let's look at those sections.  They'll prove my point.

Note that this doesn't affect all concealed carry.  (Look after the
word "except".)  It always helps to read the law before commenting on
it.

Would a prudent storekeeper carry concealed?  How about someone at
home?  Note that both are legal, and a lot of "common" people qualify
for one or the other.

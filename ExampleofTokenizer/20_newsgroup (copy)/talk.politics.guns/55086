You seem to make two points.  No one ultimately oversees the federal agencies  
you mention, and since Koresh "apparently" has a different view point from your  
Baptist upbringing, then he is not worthy of protection from religious  
persecution.  As to being the Messiah, is not Christ within us all?

Must be comforting to belong to a government approved religion.

Baptists are a cult, two, BTW, under most of the definitions in the dictionary  
of "cult".

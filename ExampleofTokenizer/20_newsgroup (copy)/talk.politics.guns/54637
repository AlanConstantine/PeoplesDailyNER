The suggestion that they Davidians committed suicide is
completely without evidence.  Except for the editorials...

Please re-word.  "propensity for allegedly dousing themselves".

already cut the power), and the propane tanks.  This sounds
a lot more likely than committing suicide by setting the place
afire.

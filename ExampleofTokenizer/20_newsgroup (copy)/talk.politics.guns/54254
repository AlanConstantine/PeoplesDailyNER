	OK, here's something for all of those people who think cops are always
more responsible then the rest of the population.  I found this article in the
Rocky Mountain Collegian, Colorado State University's newspaper.

	SUSPENDED POLICE OFFICER ARRESTED IN REVENGE TRIPLE HOMICIDE

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- A police officer afraid he would be fired for
allegedly assaulting a teen-ager walked into an auto body shop wher the youth
worked, said "You're going to die" and fatally shot him and two others, police
said.

A fourth youth was wounded.  A fifth escaped injury by hiding under a car.

The wounded youth ran about two blocks to a house after the shooting at about
midnight Tuesday and called police.  He was hospitalized in satisfactory
condition Wednesday.

Suspended police officer Robert Sabetta, 23, of Cranston, was arrested at
gunpoint over three hours after the shooting at Wilson's Auto Enterprises in
Foster, a rural town of about 4,000 people in northwest Rhode Island.

	Well, this just goes to show that cops are capable of snapping, just
like everyone else.  Now who was it who said only cops should have guns?

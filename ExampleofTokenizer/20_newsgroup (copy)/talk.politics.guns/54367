One more time.

It ain't about duck hunting.

It ain't about lone perps on lonely streets.

It's about DEFENDING OUR RIGHTS from the *GOVERNMENT*, which 
has seen fit to ignore history and attempt once again to take
them from us.  They WILL SUCCEED if we don't do something NOW.

That's why I think the NRA is a bunch of WEENIES, because they
have FORGOTTEN that fundamental fact.

Pardon all my shouting, but there seem to be a whole helluva lot
of people on Condition White, fat, dumb, and happy, sucking that
glass teat for all they're worth.... Wake up and smell the cordite,
gang, they're shooting at us, and it's high time we shot back,
at least with our keyboards.....

fly your flags at half staff and upside down,
to mourn and protest the death of the BoR.

I don't know what Traders is claiming, but it appears to me that
the Oakland Tribune has censored gun ads in the past.  Likewise
for the San Francisco Chronicle, and I have never seen a gun
ad in the San Francisco Examiner.

Specifically, about a year ago on Thursdays, when Traders placed
its ads, the Chron. ad would not have any graphics representing
any handgun sale, though text could list it.  The Trib. would
run a graphic of a handgun.  The Examiner would not have a Traders
ad at all.

Over the past year while Oakland politicians have made a lot of noise
about measures to fight crime the Trib stopped taking the Traders
ad, then started publishing it, but without any handgun graphic, then
stopped, then started.  Since the Trib. was sold some months ago it
has not had the Traders ad.  During one of these non-ad interludes
a Traders employee told me that the Trib. had refused to take their
ads.

Yes, the usual Chron. Thursday ad was there today, with graphics
representing rifles, safes, etc. as usual.

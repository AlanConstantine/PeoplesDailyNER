Not when the power has been cut off for weeks on end.  Any generators are
no doubt out of fuel, too.  So all they would have is wood stoves and
kerosene lanters (maybe).  It is alleged that the tanks pushing in the
walls knocked over the lanters, starting the fire.  Remember, the FBI
had bugs which they even used (illegally) to eavesdrop on private
conversations with the lawyers.  If a suicide order were given they
WOULD HAVE KNOWN IT IN TIME.  If the Feds had been concerned they would
have had emergency equipment ready.  Not an hour or so later, not
leaving the water THEY TURNED OFF, off.  They could have turned it back
on.  They just didn't wanna.  Scores to settle...

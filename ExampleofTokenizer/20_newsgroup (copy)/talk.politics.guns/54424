  Brent, I'm still waiting to see if there are any evidence of how the fire
got started, so I'm not going to tell you who did it...  As far as you keep
talking about the Davidians pouring kerosene all over, stop and *think*
for a second if it is possible the stove or lamp was knocked over and
started a fire, and the Davidians were pouring water on it (wrong solution
but I doubt I can do much better in their states of mind...) to try to
put it out?   

  By the way, just how far where you standing from the Davidians when you
saw them setting the place on fire?   Oh, in case you are new in town,
microwave ovens doesn't work very well when there's no electricty. :-0

  Get some *facts* before you post next time!

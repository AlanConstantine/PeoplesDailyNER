Is their a pd/freeware hard drive utility that can handle
a compressed IDE drive without screwwing it up?

Need to document occasional failures in reading/writing,
check overall integrity of disk's hardware and sectors.

I believe that all of my problems with DOS/Windows can
be isolated to my drive.  Getting occasional corrupted
files, even with smartdrive, 32 bit access turned off.
Had these problems under DOS 5.  Only with drive C.
Drive D may have had one failure, but that file was
under the control of Win/Winword on drive C.

All utilities available to me report no problems.
DOS, NDD (NU4.5).  Another symptom, SD took forever
on C, and kicked me out with a suspension till NDD run
6 to 8 times.

Thanks.

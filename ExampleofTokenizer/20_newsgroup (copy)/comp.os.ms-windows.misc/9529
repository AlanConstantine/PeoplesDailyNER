That isn't enough to change your Windows startup logo.  vgalogo.rle is not 
needed after you have installed Windows.  It is incorporated as a part of 
win.com.
	To make a new win.com, you have to concatinate three files together, 
using the /b option for a binary concatonation.  I beleive it is

copy /b win.cnf+vgalogo.lgo+vgalogo.rle mywin.com

Make sure you backup your win.com file in anotehr directory before you do this 
-- I absent-mindedly typed win.com instead of mywin.com and had to resinstall 
Windows!
	Anyway, substitute whatever .RLE file you want.  The win.cnf has the 
info needed to start Windows (think of it as a bootstrap) and vgalogo.vga has 
video information.  Just make sure that the .RLE file doesn't tip the whole 
COM file size over the 64k limit of a .COM file!
	So anyway, I use mywin.com to startup MS Windows.  Now instead of that 
annoying Micro$oft advertisment, I have the Joker (yes, from Batman) taking 
yoru picture from the screen, saying "Smile!"  Also a little bit of text: 
"Micro$oft Windows: The world's first commercially sucessful virus."  I added 
that because of the frequency of crashes. <grin>

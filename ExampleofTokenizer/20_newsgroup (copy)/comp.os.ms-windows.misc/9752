If you are managing PC's on a Novell network, get the network management
tools provided by either Sabre Software or Automated Design Systems. 
Among the many features, you'll find utilities that can help you to
manage .INI files stored on users' workstations or home directories. 
This is commercial software and well worth the money.  To date, I have
not found ANYTHING available via FTP that could compare.  Reply to the
address in my .SIG for more info.

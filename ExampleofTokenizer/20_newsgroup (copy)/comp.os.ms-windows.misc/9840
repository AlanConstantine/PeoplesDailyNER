A while ago I installed SPSS for Windows as part of an evaluation. Once
the evaluation was complete I duly deleted the software from my PC.

Unfortunately there is still a "ghost" of SPSS left: when I run
something like "Write" and go to embed an object then "SPSS Chart"
appears on the list of objects I'm offered. I looked around all
the obvious "INI" files without success. The next thing I tried
was looking for the string "SPSS Chart" in every file in the 
Windows directory. It turned up in a file called REQ.DAT (or
REG.DAT). Unfortunately the file was binary and so I didn't feel
inclined to edit it.

I'd welcome a solution for removing SPSS from the list of OLE servers.

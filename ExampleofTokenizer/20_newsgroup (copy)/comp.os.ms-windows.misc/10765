After hearing endless debate (READ: name-calling) over which os is better, dos
and windows or OS/2 and finally having enought resourses to play with a couple
of different operating systems, I have decided to put the two products to a
head to head test, as so many fellow newsposters have suggested.  I have, 
however, no desire whatsoever to use a version of os/2 which wont REALLY
do what it says (i.e. run windows apps)  OS/2 2.0-2.1 will not run windows
apps in 386 enhansed mode, something that most larger windows apps require, but
OS/2 2.2, which is supposed to be in beta test, is supposed to.  I have heard
that os/2 2.2 beta is available via ftp, and I was wondering if anyone knew
where to obtain a copy.  I would appreciate any information, as I would like, 
once and for all, to establish for myself which is the best os for my needs.

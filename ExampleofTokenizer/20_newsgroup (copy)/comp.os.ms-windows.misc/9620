As far as I have read WIN NT will be supported on Intel, DEC ALPHA and the MIPS R4000
series of processors only. I do remember though reading a rumour about Sparc support
sometime in the future. I am not sure what you mean by running "unix applications".
You would have to have SAS for WIN NT (or maybe SAS for WIN16 etc). I have read 
that MS will anounce avalaibility of WIN NT by end of May 93 (Comdex Spring). Hope
this helps.

   -----Or, if you need to use a service bureau and they're only set up to use
   Type 1 fonts. From what I've heard (pure hearsay) the results of outputting
   TT fonts as Type 1 is _not_ as good as using high-quality Type 1 fonts in
   the first place.

Unless you `print' to file with the correct resolution set for the
final output device (image setter).  A problem with TT fonts in Windows
is that they do get converted to T1 format OK, and the hinting is even used
while this is done, but the resulting T1 fonts are NOT hinted.  The result
is that they WILL work fine on a device of the resolution assumed by the
printer driver when the PS file is generated, but they will not look
good when printed at a different resolution.  

So when you print to an attached PS printer, with the PS driver set up for
this printer results, may be quite good.  But if you take a PS file made for
that printer and run it on a device of different resolution (such as an
image setter), then the results may not be so good.

Hello,

I'm trying to get a drum program to work that I downloaded from
ftp.cica.indiana.edu in the pub/pc/win3/sounds directory.  It's called
drum.zip.  

I have an ATI Stereo FX card with the latest Windows drivers installed. 
When I try to run the drum program, it reports that a MIDI device is not
installed, however the drivers utility in the control panel reports that it
is installed.  

Anyone have any idea how to set up the MIDI device so that the drum program
will work with my setup?  What I'm trying to do is use my computer as a
metronome.  Someone suggested that I try one of the drum machines that are
circulating around out there.  Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Terry

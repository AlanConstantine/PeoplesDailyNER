On ftp.cica.indiana.edu in pub/pc/win3/misc/winadv.zip is a writeup by
Steve Gibson of InfoWorld with winbench 3.11 and a number of other 
benchmark results for nine isa and four VLB video cards.  This is a 
very current upload and is likely to have any card you're currently 
giving serious consideration.  Not in XLS format.  Latest version of
WinBench that I know of is ver 3.11.  I believe they try to maintain
the same rating scale between versions, and new versions are released
to defeat the lastest coding tricks put in by driver programmers to
beat the benchmarks.  Don't know on the last one.

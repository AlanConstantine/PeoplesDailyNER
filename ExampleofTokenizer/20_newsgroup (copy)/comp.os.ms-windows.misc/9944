To clarify:  

VC++ *is* considered an upgrade for C7.  There will be no product
called C 8.0 (although the command-line compiler of VC++ lists its
version as 8.00).  C7 is not a "DOS"-only product -- it is a C/C++
compiler capable of producing executables for DOS or Windows, as is
VC++ (Pro. Ed.).  The (significant) difference is that VC++ comes with
many Windows-hosted tools (ide, etc) which assist developers in
creating Windows executables much more quickly (basically by
automating the thousands of lines of boilerplate code).  Initial
impressions have been very favorable.

Everyone who is a registered user of C7 should have received a
considerable amount of info regarding the specifics of C7. If you
haven't, call Microsoft and I'm sure they'd be happy to send you some!

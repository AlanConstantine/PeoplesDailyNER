Hello Cliff 

Many people on the internet (like us) have to pay for
every byte of data passed through subscribed news groups.

Bitmaps are large. Bitmaps cost us a lot of money. There are
special news-groups for bitmaps because of this. We don't
subscribe to them. Put you bitmaps in the right place.
Read one of the FAQ guides in the newuser groups and it
will tell you all about bitmaps and the thousands of
establishments like mine that you have just cost money.

Some of them have very limited budgets.

Go away.

P.S. This is a flame ;-)
P.P.S You distribution of "usa" didn't work.

KenB

	Path of least resistance (TM) :) :
Get WinGIF 1.4 from cica (ftp.cica.indiana.edu pub/pc/win3/(desktop?) )
It will save to native .rle format unlike PSP (an otherwise fine, fine prog)
Make a file using anything that has to be less than 30k, as Michael said,
and less than 16 colors... Import it to WinGIF as gif, pcx or bmp and
save it in you windows/system subdir as vgalogo.rle (NOT .lgo). Exit Win,
and run setup in the windows subdir. Reselect your _current_ config. Run
Win. Voila'
(minor correction: the .rle file has to be <30k. that means ~15k gif ?)
Hope it helps... (and please, please someone put this in the group's FAQ)

I believe the beta version of the service is available via ftp on 
ftp.cica.indiana.edu
in pub/pc/win3/nt called something like nwnt.zip

There is an INDEX ascii file there, which lists the programs in that directory
and what they do.

unfortunately this beta will also disable netbeui and tcp/ip over your
primary nic, so if you really want to run it, get yourself an extra nic and
bind it to that.  

Otherwise wait for next release, like I am.

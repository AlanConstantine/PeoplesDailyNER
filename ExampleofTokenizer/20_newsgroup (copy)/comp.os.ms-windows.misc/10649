It came from a reseller survey.

I don't recall any FUD here.  Maybe an example?

For the most part, this newsgroup is "attack" oriented.  Microsoft has been
attacked on anything ranging from the quality of our products, the
intelligence of our people, the integrity of our business, etc.  ANYONE
would get defensive when being baselessly attacked.  We are human beings as
well.  You should expect a response when a claim that an employee might
feel is unwarranted is leveled.

The format for Word for Windows doc files is available from Microsoft.
Call their Developer Support Services number (sorry, don't have it handy)
and ask for the Word for Windows binary file format spec.

Warning:  It is not terribly useful, and you will need to do a *lot* of
looking before you can figure out how the stuff is stored.

General primer:

Word for Windows stores its data in two chunks.  The first chunk is the
actual text in the file.  This is all stored together and has nothing
but text and graphics.  The second chunk is the formatting information.

For general use, to read a Word for Windows file, skip the first 384 bytes
of the file (its a general header).  Then read the remaining text until you
hit binary data.

Matt

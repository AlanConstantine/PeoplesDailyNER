Subject: Gatewaying Microsoft Mail/Workgroups via 9600 modem?

Our student association runs a small Novell network which has a subnetwork
of Windows for Workgroups and Microsoft Mail. The Director of Finance, en
electrical engineering student, would like to gateway this system, either
via SLIP or not, into the University's network and thus the Internet, at
the very least to exchange e-mail, but possibly also to do ftp's etc. For
now, this would be done via a 9600 bps modem.

He would like to set it up so that it would periodically call in to check
mail, but would otherwise connect whenever needed.

What is the best way to do this? Gatewaying software is available, but
what works best?

Please reply to me: dkmiller@unixg.ubc.ca
 or the D of F    : dleung@ee.ubc.ca

with a cc: to the other. I don't read all of these groups regularly, so mail
is best. If this is a common question, please pot me to a FAQ or ftp site.

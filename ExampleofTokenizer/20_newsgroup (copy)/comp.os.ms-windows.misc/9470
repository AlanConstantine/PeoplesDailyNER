	ahh, yes, this is a fun topic.  No, once the name is incribed on the
disk, that is it, it is encoded.  Not even a HEX editor will find it.  You can
write over the "Licensed to:", but you can't change the name underneth it.  I
think if you wish to change this you would have to be a pirate, and we're not
going to promote that here.

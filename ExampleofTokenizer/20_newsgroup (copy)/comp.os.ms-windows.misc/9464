This is the 2nd Reguest for Discussion ( RFD ) for the creation of 
comp.databases.ms-access 

The discussion period started on April 6 and it will last until April 28,
( 22 days ).

This is an official RFD for the creation of a new newsgroup for the
general discussion of the Microsoft Access RDMS.

NAME: COMP.DATABASES.MS-ACCESS

MODERATION: UNMODERATED. At this time, no need for a moderator has been
assertained. Future evaluation will determine if one is needed.

PURPOSE: 
Access is a new RDBMS for the Windows Operating System. It includes WYSIWYG
design tools for easy creation of tables, reports, forms and queries and a
database programming language called Access Basic.
THe purpose of the group will be to provide help to people who use Access's 
WYSIWYG design tools to create simple databases as well as to people who use 
Access Basic to create complex databases.

RATIONALE:
Eventhough Access is a new RDBMS, it is very popular because of its Graphical
Development enviroment and its initial low price.
Been a version 1.0 product means that all Access users are Novices.
For that reason a newsgroup is needed where Access users can discuss 
their experiences with the product and answer each other's questions.

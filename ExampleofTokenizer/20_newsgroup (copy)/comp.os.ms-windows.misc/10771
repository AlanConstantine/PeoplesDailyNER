Shareware is available from the net, magazines, distributors, clubs,
friends, and bulletin boards. I don't think people have any problems
getting hold of it.

Fill gaps in Dos? There's no need for many people - Dos 5 provides
more services than I need as it is. I just run Windows on top of it.

BTW, my Windows must be an operating system - it provides a Disk
Operating System that Dos can't access. (NFS...) :-)

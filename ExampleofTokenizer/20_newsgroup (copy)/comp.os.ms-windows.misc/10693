Hello,

recently I noticed there is a directory named "DiskImage" in my disk.  I didn't
notice it before and I wonder if while installing an application an image of 
the disk was created, or if Win3.1 automatically created a backup of its files.
I couldn't find any documentation on the diskimage utility; having an image of
the disk is taking *a lot* of disk space.  Does anybody know if this is just 
something the people who installed Win3.1 did or it is a backup mechanism?

Thanks,

Anibal

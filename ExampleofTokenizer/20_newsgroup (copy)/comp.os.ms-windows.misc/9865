	I have just checked it and you have three files that are loaded:
	PROTMAN :  128 Bytes
	DRIVER	: 9072 Bytes
	WORKGRP	: 4416 Bytes

	No W4WG uses it's own drivers.

	Not that I know of, I bought two copies, had some problems with one
	installed both from the same copie, no problems. Do worry I just had

	It will replace all older files (I think) and prompt you for the
	others.

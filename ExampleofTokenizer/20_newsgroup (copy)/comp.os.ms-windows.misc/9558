I've got a probelm with printing envelops on my deskjet 550C from Word
for Windows.

History: when I had a Deskjet 500, I had to modify the macro so that
it would disable reverse printing since there seemed to be a bug that
interferred with printing envelops.  That bug is still present, however...

Now: the problem I have is that my DeskJet 550 print driver (came with
the printer I bought in December) still wants to print the envelops in
PORTRAIT mode.  However, the DeskJet 550 feeds envelops the from the
narrow end (i.e. landscape mode).  How do I get the printer to print
the envelops in the correct orientation?

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not post this to the net since:
    (a) due to end of the semester cruch, I can't keep up on these groups,
and (b) I will summarize the best answer(s) to the net anyhow!

Thanks in advance,
Craig Stevenson

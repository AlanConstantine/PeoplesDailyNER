We have a LAN where we are doing development on product for multiple platforms. 
For the moment we are only working on MAC and DOS/Windows. The department has   
always used sneaker net to transport files to the MAC, since it requires a      
filter to strip out the <LF> characters.                                        

Until recently no one concidered using any version control to mediate, and as   
a result, the 5 programmers spent a great deal of time merging files together   
at the end of each week so that a new system could be build. We are now trying  
to streamline this process, but are hampered by the lack of software that will  
allow us to share files across PC and MAC platforms.                            

I understand that PVCS used to do this, but that they no longer support the MAC 
product (anyone know why ??  Polytron ?).                                       

I have seen people ask about development in multiple platforms, so I assume that
ours is not a new problem.  Who has had to deal with it ?  What solutions have  
you come up with?                                                               

thanks in advance for any and all suggestions via posting or EMAIL. If there are
enough EMAIL responses then I will post a synopsis of the knowledge.

You could use DOS 6 to do this partly.  You can set up different config.sys
and autoexec.bat commands for each user, and they just have to select their
menu option on bootup.  Then you can have the autoexec.bat copy the win.ini
and system.ini files and change directories for them.  When they exit windows,
it can copy back generic .ini files if you want.

This is the only way I can think of.  There may be some programs somewhere
that allow you to do this better, though using DOS 6 allows each person to
have a custom config.sys and autoexec.bat.

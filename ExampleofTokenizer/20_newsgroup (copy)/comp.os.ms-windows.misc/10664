Which translates to 7% not satisfied.  I don't think it's the awkward 
recursive deletion that's bugging people, it certainly isn't the nice Windows 
interfaces for new DOS accessories (CPAV, defrager, undelete).

	As far as I've noticed, it's DoubleSpace crashes.

Frankly, the fairly high rates of DoubleSpace crashes I've heard of surprises 
me!  I figured that since the OS is presumably aware of DoubleSpace, it is 
less likely to crash (unlike Stacker, which fools the OS... but DO is gullible 
anyway :).  DOS 6 _is_ aware of DoubleSpace isn't it?

Anyway, good job on DOS 5, and DOS 6 is good for new users.  Just beware the 
doublespace!

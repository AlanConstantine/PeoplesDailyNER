Gee, I remember the old 8" FLOPPY disks we used on an S-100 CP/M system
back in high school.  Not to mention those old 24" multi-platter disk 
packs that held about 15MB that went in the big washing machine
drives at the local college I took some programming classes at.
And this was even in the early '80's....

Hello Netters

	I recenlty aquired enough money to purchase a laser printer.
The other day, I bought the COMPUTER SHOPPER mag.  I was looking through
printer review section and noticed the WINPRINTER800.  The machine is 
incredibly low priced for all the features it has 

			800 dpi!
			8Meg RAM
			Postscript compatable
			envelope printing

My question is does anyone have one of these or know why the price is so
cheap?  I would appricaiate it if someone would pass on their knowledge
on this subject.  Thanks alot!

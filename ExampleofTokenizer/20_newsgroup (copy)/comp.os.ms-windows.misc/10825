I know that there is a list of the best shareware and public domain
programs for Windows at the cica ftp site, but unfortunately it is a
year old.  The list author made it sound like the list was going to be
updated every month.  Is it still being updated?  Does anyone else
compile a similar list?
 
Also are there any individual suggestions as to what the best
shareware/public domain programs are?  I'm interested in good software
in just about every category (please try and include the ftp site and
exact file name, if possible, in your post).

Thanks, 
Sam

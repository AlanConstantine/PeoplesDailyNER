Everyone seems to think that this man's mouse problem is mechanical (its dirty)
 I have been having a similar problem with my mouse, and it only occurs when ru
nning windows and therefore cannot be mechanical in nature. I'm running a mouse
 systems compatible mouse on a 486 66 DX2 with a trident 1 meg video card and a
m experienceing similar jumpiness as well as strange font subsitutions and mous
e traces left on screen and windows gpf errors. HELP!!!

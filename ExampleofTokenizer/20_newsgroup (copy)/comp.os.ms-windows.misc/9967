I am running Windows 3.1, Windows for Work Groups and just loaded Dos 6.

What`s happening appears as a graphics problem with File Manager.  I've
added some menubar buttons but there appears to be a gray boxed region
that covers the top 2/3'rds of the button row.  

These buttons are in a row below the pulldown menus.  the pulldown menus
look fine, and the disk label region looks fine, but you only see the bottom
few pixels of the task buttons.

Anyone else experience this?

Thanks.

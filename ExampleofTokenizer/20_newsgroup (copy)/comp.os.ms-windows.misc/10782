	This is one of the trickiest problems w/ Win 3.1 ... Personally I run
Telix 3.2 for DOS under Windows just fine (and 've been waiting for the Win
version froever... :) ), but I have to admit I am the exception to the rule:
I have tried installing various DOS comm progs on friends' machines, most of
them w/ big problems... Some of the stuff you have to lookout for: 
1) ALWAYS run the prog thru a .PIF, never by calling its .exe, 2) In the .PIF
_always_ toggle on _lock_application_memory_ --actually this is something
MS points out in the readme.wri file, and is especially critical for downloading
3) Go under Ctrl Panel/386 enh and check for _all_ your COM ports 'Alway Warn'
--it will help u w. debugging this thing and it's 'healthier' 4) Check where
are u running the mouse from - com port - 5) check the com port addresses from
your BIOS setup and from Ctrl Panel/Ports/(Setup?)/Advanced..
These might help u... If yu still have problems, get $100 and buy Procomm+Win..,
:) Hope it helps somehow...

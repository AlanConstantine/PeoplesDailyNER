     I know that I've seen this question asked before, but I don't remember
seeing any answers..So here it is again:

     Does any one know of an ftp site where the WD90C31 driver might reside?
I've checked cica, and I'm sure it's not there (I'm refering to the new
version of the driver that came out in 2(?)/93).  I have seen it on c-serve,
but I hesitate to d/l 1 meg. at 2400 bps unless I really have to!
     Alternativly, is it possible to get Paradise (or WD) to mail me the new
drivers, or don't they do that.

     Finally, is it even worth the hassle of getting these things, or is
there not much improvement over my 10/92 version?

                             Thanks for the info,
                                    Peter

I'm not 100% sure, but I think the T800 was a 25MHz transputer?  so ya tie
a gazillion of them together to get 100mips.  (The newest is the T9000
which kicks anyone's butt :)... haven't seen them used much though).

Anyway, to respond, I think the Pentium (CISC) is better than the more advanced
RISC (e.g., like the alpha, etc.  the 66MHz Pentium has approximately the
same "performance" as the superduper 133MHz Alpha - here, performance is the
weird Specint92 that everyone refers to? - this is what I *heard* - the
Alpha still kicks in the P5's butt in fp - again, this is what I *heard*).
and in the computing world, if you sell lots of chips (like intel), and
make it faster (like intel), you are the winner (like intel), even though
you have a sucky architecture from over 10 years ago (like intel :0).

If you can make a "CISC" chip (superscalar, superduperpipelined, superfast)
with the ideas behind the "RISC" ideology, you got a CISC chip.  And then
I admit I can't see the advantages of RISC over CISC...

If the latest technology is a generation behind, then it sucks (relatively
speaking).

Now I may sound like I like intel, but I'll have to say that the P5 is some
real kick butt pile of Si and SiO2...

But I hope that Motorola really catches up with the 68K line... or I'm gonna
start crying...

(From the Windows Resource Toolkit (for Win4Workgroups)), add an entry to
your "system.ini" file under the [NonWindowsApp] section:

    CommandEnvSize=NNNN

"This sets the COMMAND.COM env size, where NNNN must either be 0 or
between 160 and 32768.  A value of 0 disables the setting.  If this
value is too small or too big, it is rounded up to 160 or down to 32768.
If the value is less than the current size of the actual environment,
this setting is disabled, as if it were 0.  If you specify the
environment size in a PIF file for COMMAND.COM, the PIF setting
overrides this setting.  The default is 0 with MSDOS versions earlier
than 3.2.  Otherwise, the default value is the /e: option in the
SHELL= command in CONFIG.SYS.  To set this value, you must edit your
SYSTEM.INI [and reboot]."


I have used this entry, as well as relied on the default /e: from
the CONFIG.SYS shell= line, and both give larger environments.  If
you don't use one of these, then the environment passed by windows
to each new DOS box is just a little bit bigger than the environment
_variables_ present when windows was started.  (No matter how big
the DOS env was, when windows starts, it truncates all unused space
except for a few bytes.)  This should allow your batch file to run,
but your mileage may vary.

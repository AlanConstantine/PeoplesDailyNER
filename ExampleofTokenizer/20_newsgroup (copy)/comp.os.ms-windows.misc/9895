Stacker achieves better compression ratio than DOS6, yet the
latter comes with virus detection, memory manager, and multiple
booting. Each of them are not so good as the NAV, QEMM or NDOS
in my opinion, but with a package of only $45, it's nice if
haven't yet installed all of those stuffs.

Both certainly work with Win31.

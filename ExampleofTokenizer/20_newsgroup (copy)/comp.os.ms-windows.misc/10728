Hi. I would like to know if there is a seperate newgroup for 
discussion of MS Test or Quality Assurance issues. Or, if not, what
newsgroup would be the appropriate one to use.

Does compuserve or microsoft themselves have a bbs people can call
for help on such?

Thanks.   Please email response to djw@wang.com

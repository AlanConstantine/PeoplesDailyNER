	Just got a ss24X based on its good ratings, but am a little
under-impressed.  First, is it's performance in 16.7 mill. supposed
to be comparable to a Trident 8900 (or other unaccelerated VGA)?  I 
came up with only OK performance on WinSpeed.  In 256, it was between
good and great.  Second, does anyone know where to get that JPG viewer
"for the SS24X".  I saw it on cica or something.  Does it work better.

Thanks for any help.

Greg

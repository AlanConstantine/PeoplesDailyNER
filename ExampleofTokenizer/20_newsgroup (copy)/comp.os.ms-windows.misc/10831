In trying to use the Equation editor in Word for Windows 2.0 I get
a couple of error messages along the lines of:

>Can't find font MT Extra for default printer. Some characters my not be
>displayed or printed.Try installing Equation editor again or reinstall a 
>new printer.

Similar for the font Fences.

I know I have these fonts on my system but are unable to use them.
I have tried both of these solutions to no avail.

If anyone has had similar problems and has found a way to fix this, could 
they let me know. It is urgently required !!

Thanks ,

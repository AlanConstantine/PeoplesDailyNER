Hmmmmm you know this happened to me also.
I am not sure what caused it.  I think there might have been
a system error and dumped windows.  I came back and all was well
except no groups. Program Manager was EMPTY.  All the .grp files were
in the directory.  I had to remake the groups with the new and group
selection.  ALL THE ICONS AND FILES INSIDE THE GROUPS WERE STILL THERE
AND WORKING FINE.  Just the groups had gone out of program manager.

Strange !!!!

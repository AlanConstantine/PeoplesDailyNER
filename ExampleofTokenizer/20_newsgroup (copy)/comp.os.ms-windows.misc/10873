Very well indeed.  At home (a VL Bus version of the Graphics Pro) I can stretch
an AVI window to 640x480 and it will continue to play back smoothly.  It drops
a few more frames but on most machines even attempting such a thing would mean
one frame update every 30 seconds.  An ISA Graphics+ was able to do "Zoom by
2" without any perceptible performance penalty.  It is the best performance
I've seen so far with the possible exception of an Intel Indeo board (which
uses overlay so it doesn't have to move the decompressed data over the ISA
bus at any point).

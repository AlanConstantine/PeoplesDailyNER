Ok, I just got a new 486/66 16 Mb, with a ATI Ultra pro and I can't get
into windows. It says that I need more memory available, but I have 15mb
ogf extended mem & 512k of conventionnal. I have disabled my memory aperture
because it didn't find any "FREE" memory, but it still gave me a message that
the memory aperture will conflict with system memory. I think that's why
it want to get in Windows.

Any help will greatly be appriciated.

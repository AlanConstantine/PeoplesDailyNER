Help, I'm bored with the current Windows backgrounds we have here and am 
looking for some nifty pictures to use instead.  I've seen from previous posts
that many sites exist that store pictures - available through anonymous ftp.
Except that I can't ftp to remote sites from my machine, what I CAN do is use
'ftpmail' - mail a list of commands to a server and receive a mail of files, 
and/or data back.
Does anyone know of sites, with Windows compatible pictures, that can be 
accessed in such a way??? 
If you do would you please post them.
TIA
   Mark.

PS. Maybe this would make a useful FAQ

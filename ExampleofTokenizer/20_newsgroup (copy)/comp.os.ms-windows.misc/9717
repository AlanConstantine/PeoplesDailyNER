I have used both version 1.17 drivers for Win 3.1 and the new 2.03 drivers.
I have had none of these problems.  No GPF's at all.  I have a feeling that
your problems are not with the card or drivers.  The ATI Ultra drivers are
considered some of the most reliable on the market, and the SS 24X ones 
seem quite good as well.  Maybe you should check BIOS problems in your
Gateway.  I know a few people with Gateway DX2's, and all of them have
found some problem or other with compatibility -- especially with graphics.

The only GPF's I have ever had can be directly attributable to using/
abusing applications.  I even got the newest drivers from Diamond when 
people started complaining.  I still only have one small problem with
them, and it is that the hardware cursor is slightly jumpy during writes/
reads to the swap file.

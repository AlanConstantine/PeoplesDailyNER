Been messin roun progman.ini have ye?  I'm gessing you've been "tuning"
the system, that's the only way I can remember getting a blank screen
from CTRL-ESC.... when one of the PROGMAN.INI parameters was twinked to
0 or 3, can't remember.  I've never seen Win 3 do something like that on 
her own, Captain.

There has been a long running discussion over changing the Startup
logo for Windows for a few weeks here. While all the COPY methods are
great & haven't seen any mention of a program that will do it for
you..... 

Well... I found one on CICA called winlogo (Can't remember where
unfortuantely), and it seems to work real well... even comes with a
couple example .RLE files. 

What I'd really like though is a way to create .RLE files myself,
specifically the RLE4 format mentioned in the winlogo readme file. Can
anyone point me in the direction of such a beast with a REAL directory
path ?? All the ones I've seen mentioned didn't pan out.....

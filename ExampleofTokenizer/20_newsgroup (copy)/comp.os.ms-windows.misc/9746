Hi, I was wondering if anyone out there knows of any books that give helpful
hints and tips on writing thesis papers in WfW.  I know about the dissertation
template that comes with word but I want more.  I would like to have tips on
how to use all the {seq ...} , {bookmark ...} , {index ...} , { chapter ...},
fields that are available in word.  I have looked through the help files,etc.
but they really don't explain a whole lot.  I will post the results(That means
email me first) if I get a lot of different suggestions since I think this
might be of help to lots of crazy grad students such as myself. Thanks.

p.s. How do you change the font that Help uses when printing a topic?  The 
     default is so choppy and hard to read.

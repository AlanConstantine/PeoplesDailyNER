re: What to do after the high speed modem arrives.       Edition 01 Apr 93

This article applies only to Windows 3.0 and 3.1, and not to NT, OS/2
or DOS apps not running under Windows.

One of the unadvertised limitations of most current Windows PCs is that
their RS-232C (serial, COM) performance is seriously deficient.  Almost
everyone who purchases a high-speed modem (V.32bis, V.32, PEP or HST)
discovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept
an incoming FAX (at 9600+) after upgrading the modem.  Overrun and retry
errors abound, even when the only active application is the datacomm or
FAX program.  If the transfer completes at all, it may take even longer
than with the old 2400bps modem.


There are three reasons for the problem:

1. The Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitters (UARTs) used in most
   PCs are primitive Ns8250 devices with single-byte FIFO buffers.  If the
   operating system/driver cannot read and flush each character at high
   interrupt rates, the next incoming character overwrites the FIFO and
   the previous one is lost.  DOS, being a fairly single-minded
   environment during datacomm, can usually keep up. Windows can't.

2. Windows has more operating system overhead than plain DOS, and
   interrupts often take longer to service.  Overruns are much more likely
   than under DOS.  As soon as you report to your PC/modem vendor that you
   are losing data, you may be advised that "you need to upgrade to a
   16550". More likely, since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance
   about this issue,  you'll get no useful advice at all.  Most of the
   store-front and mail-order sources I spoke with in attempting to solve
   my own problem had never heard the term "16550" and many didn't even
   know what a UART was.

3. Even your PC has Ns16550A UARTs (and PS/2's do), or if you can upgrade
   your mother/COM board or add a new COM board, you may STILL experience
   errors and overruns because the standard MicroSoft Windows COM drivers
   don't take full advantage of the 16550.  Windows 3.1 is improved in this
   regard over 3.0, but I still recommend a driver upgrade.  Applications
   like ProComm+/Win (which is what I use) cannot get around this problem
   by themselves.

If you have a modem CARD, you may not have a problem, as the modem part of
the card can be designed to be aware of the state of the UART, and avoid
overrunning it; however, I wouldn't want to bet that the card designers
were that clever, and will insist on a 16550 UART if I ever buy a modem
card.  Some modem cards don't even have conventional UARTs, but if they
are to work with standard Windows drivers, they need to simulate one.
Use MSD.EXE (below) to see what the modem card is, or is pretending to be.


The Hardware Situation.

The UARTs on most PC COM ports are based on National Semiconductor Ns8250
or Ns16450 chips (or megacells inside VLSI chips where you can't replace
them).  You can ID the UART type on your system by running the MicroSoft
diagnostic program \WINDOWS\MSD.EXE.  Be sure to run it in DOS *before*
bringing up Windows.   The Windows serial API may prevent MSD from
accurately identifying a 16550 if you run it from a Windows DOS prompt.

The Ns16550 UART has separate 16-byte transmit and receive FIFOs with
configurable trigger levels, and can run reliably at clock rates up to
460,800 bps, although with current modem technology, there's no point in
pushing your luck by going over 115,200 bps. The 16550 has shorted access
cycle times than the 16450 or 8250.  The 16550 also has DMA capability, but
it is not clear that any PC drivers ever use this.  For more technical info,
see National Semiconductor Application Note AN-491.

So, what UART component do you have?

Try to locate the UART on your mother board, multi-function I/O card, COM
board or ISA/MCA modem card.  If you can't find a socketed component with
the numbers "8250" or "16450", your COM ports are probably buried in VLSI,
and you won't be able to perform a chip replacement.  If you can DISABLE
your VLSI COM ports (as I chose to do), you can at least add an aftermarket
COM board.

If you have one or more socketed 8250 or 16450 chips, you can buy plug-in
Ns16550AFN or PC16C550CN (low power CMOS version) ICs from several
suppliers typically for $9 to $15 each.  The "N" chip is the normal 40-pin
dual-in-line package.  Other styles are available, but avoid any Ns16550
chips without the "A" (the 16C550C are presumably all OK).

Early Ns chips have bugs, although National will reportedly exchange those
of their own manufacture for free.  Clone chips are available from various
IC makers other than National.  The manual for the TurboCom drivers states
support for the following (apparently equivalent) chips:
National Semiconductor: 16550A, 16551, 16552
Chips&Technology:       82C607
Texas Instruments:      t16c550a
Silicon Systems:        73M550
VLSI                    16C550
TurboCom warns about the pre-"A" Ns16550 and Western Digital 16C550,
says that problems have been reported with early IBM PS/2 55SX and 70
systems (IBM reportedly will upgrade them).

If you DON'T have socketed 8250/16450 chips, you'll need to buy an after-
market COM or multi-function board. If this is a modem card situation, you
may be hosed. To add a new COM or multi-function card, you'll need to
either disable the COM1/2 port(s) you are replacing, or re-assign them to
COM3/4 (although watch out for IRQ conflicts without TurboCom).

Although cheaper cards are available, in the interest of getting the
problem solved quickly I elected buy the Modular Circuit Technology
MCT-AIO+ card from:

JDR Microdevices
2233 Samaritan Drive
San Jose  CA  95124
(800) 538-5000 voice US
(408) 559-1200 voice other
(800) 538-5005 FAX US

The MCT-AIO+ (and the "+" is important) sells for $89.95.  It is an 8-bit
ISA card providing:

Port Type  Connector  Address and IRQ        Comments
COM        DB9M       COM 1,2,3 IRQ 2,3,4,5  Ns16550AFN in socket
COM        ribbon     COM 2,3,4 IRQ 2,3,4,5  Ns16550AFN in socket
Parallel   DB25F      LPT1,2,3  IRQ 5,7
Game       ribbon

The kit includes a ribbon cable and DB25F connector for the secondary COM
port, a ribbon cable/connector for the game port, two bulkhead plates for
the ribbon-based connectors and a 9F-to-25F adaptor cable.  Each port can
be individually disabled, and the COM ports have TX, RX, RTS, CTS, DTR,
DCD, and DSR jumpers.

JDR also sells a Super-I/O m-f card that also has IDE.

I have heard from several people about less expensive m-f I/O cards
with 16550s:

TSD Systems
(407) 331-9130
$19.95 for the card, plus $9.95 per 16550.

Greenfield Trading and Distributors
(518) 271-2473 (voice), (518) 271-7811(FAX).
Their card is $33 w/one 16550, $45 w/2, and they sell 16550AFNs for $13.

R&S DATA SYSTEMS, INC.
820 East Highway 434
Longwood, FL  32750
PHONE: (407) 331-1424
FAX: (407) 331-8606
2COM/LPT/Game card w/2 16550s for $39

I have no personal experience with any of the firms except JDR.

Meanwhile, back at the MCT card from JDR... I only needed two serial ports,
and am running out of IRQs on my PC, so I disabled my built-in VLSI-based
8250 ports. However, with the TurboCom driver (below), I could have set
the internals as COM3 and 4, using IRQ sharing.


The Software Situation

Simply upgrading to 16550 UARTs will not completely solve common overrun
problems.  The standard MS serial drivers don't take full advantage of the
16550. The Windows 3.0 drivers are even less capable, and the Windows 3.1
drivers have the following limitations:
 - They enable only the receive FIFO, and only at rates above 2400 bps.
 - They never enable the transmit FIFO, which  results in an interrupt
   rate of 10x during uploads.
 - They set the trigger level at 14 bytes (too high - it's easy for 2
   more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the FIFO).
 - The Ports menu of the Control Panel only allows speeds up to 19200.
   With a V.32bis modem,  sparse data and text can easily compress 3:1
   or more, suggesting that a host DTE connect rate of 57,600 bps would
   be effective.
 - The API won't accept rates above "CBR_128000".
 - The API won't let DOS programs know there is a 16550 there, and even
   if it did, DOS programs that aren't 16550-aware get little benefit
   from a 16550 port with the standard drivers.
 - They don't allow IRQ sharing for COM3,4.
 - The BIOS doesn't initialize COM3,4 properly in many systems.
 - Windows provides no workaround for apps that don't provide port
   speed options above 19200 bps.

These problems are reportedly NOT solved in Windows NT or DOS 6.0, and may
or may not be addressed in any Windows releases after 3.1 (but before 4.0).
Rumors suggest they "may" be solved in Windows "4.0".

You can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying
a copy of "TurboCom", current version 1.2, from:

Bio-Engineering Research
Pacific CommWare Division
180 Beacon Hill Lane
Ashland  OR   97520-9701
(503) 482-2744 voice
(503) 482-2627 FAX
(503) 482-2633 BBS
MCImail:    344-5374
CompuServe: 71521,760

Price was around $50 as I recall.  Bio-Eng is not set up to accept credit
cards, so I had to send a check.  Egghead and 1-800-Software list TurboCom
but as far as I know, they don't stock it.  Bio is not a software company
per se.  They apparently needed reliable hi-speed serial connections for
an in-house instrument application, wrote their own driver, discovered a
market for it, revised it to be a general purpose COM driver suite. They
recently upgraded it for Windows 3.1.  It is run-time licensed.

I now have my host (DTE) connect rate set to 57,600 bps most of  my
datacomm apps, and I am having ZERO problems with downloads. I routinely
see transfer rates that exceed 2,000 bps. I am also using 115,200 bps
when linking an HP95LX to my PC, with lossless bi-directional I/O.
Uploads to various remote systems are another matter, because many hosts
are still using antique UARTs and drivers.

Note that 19200 is still the highest rate that the Windows 3.1 Port menu
in Control Panel will allow in configuring a COM port.  TurboCom gets
around this by allowing you to specify, on each port, a factor that will
set the real UART rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the
Windows APIs and dialog boxes.

I also have CTS/RTS hardware flow control enabled, and I suggest that you
do the same.  Even if you only ever transfer 7-bit ASCII data, Xon/XOff is
not a sufficiently reliable method of flow control.  The informal (DEC)
standard for Xon/Xoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another
16 (yes, sixteen) bytes after receipt of the Xoff from the receiving
system or device.  The 16 byte FIFO in the 16550 is clearly not big enough
to let us rely exclusively on Xon/Xoff.  A well-respected datacomm
engineer has informed me that the 16550's can't really do CTS/RTS all
by itself in the DOS/Windows environment, so using data rates above
115,200 may still be risky.

Even with hardware flow control, a 16550 with TurboCom can still
experience overruns in very busy systems, with lots of apps running and
serious swapping in progress. If this is your situation, you may need to
buy a co-processed COM board, but this will cost you more than a
16550/TurboCom upgrade.  A review of two such boards, and a review of
TurboCom, can be found in the Feb'93 issue of "Windows Sources" magazine.
I suggest trying a 16550/TurboCom upgrade first, and experiment with
process priorities and time slices if you are a "power user" whose
thrashing system still runs into comm problems.


Closing Soapbox Comments

The state of RS-232C serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across
the computer industry.  Because it is the oldest standard I/O interface,
the job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be
assigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer
companies.  The design of the average serial port is at least ten years
behind the state of the art. In my last job, with a major workstation
vendor, I lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the
initial designs of a new system.  That family of machines was
subsequently introduced with 16550 ports.  However, this is the
exception.  Few computer companies seem to have any champions for decent
I/O.

You may as well learn what you can about serial I/O, because this
situation shows no sign of improving soon.  When V.FAST arrives, I expect
cries of outrage from Windows users world-wide whose 8250 PCs "sort of"
work today with V.32, but will fail miserably with V.FAST.  Without a
hardware-buffered UART (like the 16550) and without software drivers that
use that UART to best advantage, a V.FAST modem will be a waste of money.

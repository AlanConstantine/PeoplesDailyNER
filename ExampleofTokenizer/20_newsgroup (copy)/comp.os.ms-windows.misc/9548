Hi, everybody:
    I guess my subject has said it all.  It is getting boring
looking at those same old bmp files that came with Windows.  So,
I am wondering if there is any body has some beautiful bmp file
I can share.  Or maybe somebody can tell me some ftp site for
some bmp files, like some scenery files, some animals files,
etc....  I used to have some, unfortunately i delete them all.

Anyway could me give me some help, please???

thanks a lot!

john

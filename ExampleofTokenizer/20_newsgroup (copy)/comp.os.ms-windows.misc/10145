Generally, the second or third major release usually takes care of it.
My advice, based on plenty of personal experience, is to never buy the
first version of anything from Microsoft.  This includes major version
number upgrades from previous releases, such as Microsoft C 6.00.
Always wait at least for the "a" upgrade or slipstream upgrade if
you're going to buy it.

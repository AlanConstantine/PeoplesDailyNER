Hello,

I want a little network for 3 users. All users want to run Windows.
The most important things I want for the network are: file-sharing,
mail utility, two printers on one of the computers and a fax/modem
card on one of the computers. We all want to use each others harddisk.

My idea was to buy three computers (one 486DX and two 386DX). All
three have a 40Mb local harddisk, the 486 also has a very large
harddisk. All three also have a network card. The 486 is connected to
the printers and contains the fax/modem card. And last but not least:
Workgroups for Windows.

My questions:
- Is this possible?
- What exactly are the possibilities and advantages of Workgroups
  for Windows?
- Will all the computers be fast enough? Behind all three, someone
  is working.

Thanks,
Martijn

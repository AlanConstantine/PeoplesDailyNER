Take a look at WinQVT/net -- the latest version is QVT/net 3.4
It comes in versions that are direct to packet driver, as well as a PC NFS 
version.

It is priced quite low; registration = $40, student registration = $20, and is 
a nice package -- comes complete with VT220 terminal emulation, FTP, POP3 
client, LPR, and NNTP client.

You can FTP it from "biochemistry.bioc.cwru.edu" /pub/qvtnet/qvtnet34.zip

It was also uploaded to ftp.cica.indiana.edu recently.

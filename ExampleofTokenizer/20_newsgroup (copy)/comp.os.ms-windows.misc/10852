Cliff, do you know the difference between "Windows" and "Win-OS/2"?  Here's
a helpful hint:

Running "Windows" under OS/2 2.0 is only possible in real mode, in a DOS
box. Of course, this is only possible with Windows 3.0, since Windows 3.1
no longer has a "real mode".

The ability to run standard mode, the ability to have an OS/2 <-> Windows
clipboard, the ability to run seamless, and a few other things were all added
by IBM to "Win-OS/2".

Now, everybody who is running "Windows" in real-mode in a DOS box under OS/2
2.x raise your hand. Finally, everybody who is running "Win-OS/2" under OS/2,
raise YOUR hand.

Get the picture, Cliff?

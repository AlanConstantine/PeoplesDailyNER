Does anyone have any information or better, first-hand experience,
of the new Epson bubblejet printer - Stylus 800??

I'm particularly interested in hearing how well it works under Windows;
I presume that a special printer driver is required - is it supplied
as standard? Is it able to print everything that a standard Postscript
laserprinter could??

Many thanks for any replies - George

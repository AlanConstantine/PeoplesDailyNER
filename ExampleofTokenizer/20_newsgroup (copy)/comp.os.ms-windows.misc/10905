: In other words, it is your *opinion* that MSW3.1 is inferior to its

No.  It is technically inferior to the OS/GUIs that I listed.  I have already
described why.  To say briefly:

System 7 --easier to learn and use.  There have been independent studies to 
           that effect.
OS/2     --Can run MSW applications and has more stable multitasking.
NeXTSTep --easier to learn, use, and program. More stable multitasking
UNIX/X   --As easy to learn and use.  More stable multitasking.

With the prpoer setup, all of these will exchange data with MSW machines as
well as MSW machines will amongst themselves, so interoperability is not
an issue.

By this criterion, it is inferior.  If you have another, then perhaps I am
incorrect.  Do you pick up the glove?

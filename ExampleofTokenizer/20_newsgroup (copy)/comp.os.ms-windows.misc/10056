I recently set Windows 3.1 up on my 486DX-33 VLB system, and I didn't
notice until last night that I don't have the 386 icon in my control
panel.  I don't remember Windows setup asking me about 386 enhanced
mode (whether I wanted it or not).  Now I've got a program that I 
just bought (Aldus Freehand 3.1) that is telling me that I should be
running Windows in enhanced mode (looks like I'm running in standard
mode).

How can switch to enhanced mode without the little icon thingie?  Are
there some issues involved with VESA LB systems which cause Windows
to not want to give you enhanced mode? 

Thanks for any help!!

I posted a message here some time ago asking why my mouse was so jumpy.  
Well, I think I know why, and it doesn't have anything to do with the 
mouse.  It seems to be the video driver!  Here's why I think that:

A few weeks ago I helped a guy install the driver for his S3 video card for 
windows.  He had been using the normal Windows default VGA driver.  We don't 
have the same kind of mouse (mine is microsoft serial and his is an off-
brand serial mouse).  His mouse worked fine until I installed the S3 (v1.4) 
driver on his system, then his mouse became really jumpy too!

Is there anything I can do?  I need high resolution since I display LOTS of 
stuff on my screen (AMI Pro, Pegasus Mail for Windows, WP Office 4.0 -- 
sorry, nondisclosure!, and alot more).  I noticed there are S3 drivers on 
ftp.cica, but they are the same version that I already have and they are no 
help (I already tried!).

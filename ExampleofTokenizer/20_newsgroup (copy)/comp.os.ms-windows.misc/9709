  Here is an annoying problem. Whenever I save an icon which contains dark
colors like dark red or dark purple, these colors are converted to the
bright colors. This happens with every icon editor including the image
editor that came with SDK. I don't have this problem with .BMP files
either; only with .ICO files or icon libraries. The problem is with
the icon colormap field in the icon file header. Checking the file
with a binary editor, I can see that the masks are OK. By editing the
colormap manually (copying from another icon that I didn't edit) I can
fix the colors. Does anybody know what may be causing this problem? 

Thanks.

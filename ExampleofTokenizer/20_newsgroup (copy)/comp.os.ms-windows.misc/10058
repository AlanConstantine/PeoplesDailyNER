Well, I got  WINZIP from cica (don't know which version, but I think
it's the latest, as this is not long ago), and I was initially imressed.
But here's the low-down:

WINZIP is a *great* progra, *as long as you only unzip*.  It lets you
vew files, unzip only selected files, and even puts the files in a
/checkout directory, and creates a "checkout" .grp and group if you want
to check the program out.  It even prompts for deletion of these on
exit, if you didn;t like the program.

*HOWEVER* (big however over here).  I have problems zipping.  I don't
konw specifics on this, or ammount of consistency, but sometimes when I
"zip" a few files, or add a file to a .zip, dos will violate something
or other, and I'll be asked (in a kind, micro$oft kind of way) to quit
all applications, quit windows, and restart my computer.  I don't know
(as I said) how consistent this is, as I jdont' zip much (and when I do,
now I just go to dos and use it from there, or just use the "run" cmd)
but I *do* know it's happened when I added files to an existing .zip
file, *and* when I created a new .zip file, using selected files only.
I don't know if it's happened when I zip an entire dir.

Still, it has a rather nice interface, and quite useful "unzip"ing
functions.  If the above is fixed, I'll be the first to register the new
ver.  (as for now, a good old, "run-->unzip *.zip" will work.

(PS> if a new ver *is* out that fixes these, please let me know).

peace,
Mickey

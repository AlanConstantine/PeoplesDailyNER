Please research carefully.  Just because a fax modem behaves like
a printer on a "local" machine, doesn't guarantee functionality 
when a "local" machine has fax software printing to a "remotely
installed" fax card.  I tried this with Workgroups and the 
fax software didn't like it at all.  Could have been WinFAX's
peculiarisms but I don't think so.  A lot of special hardware
interaction takes place internally.  In my case, a FAX manager
program merely "intercepts" the print job and spools it to
it's own directory, not print manager's spool directory.  To
software, it appears the job was "printed".  Print Manager 
plays NO part in the handling of the actual process.

Pardon me if I've incorrectly assumed this is what you were
up to.  A truely network-aware fax-modem will most likely be
required, or a lot of weird setup and tinkering.

Good luck.

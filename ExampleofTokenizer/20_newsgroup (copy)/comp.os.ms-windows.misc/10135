I've been using Windows NT (tm) since the October release, and I have to 
say that the March release is really a big improvement.  Windows NT (tm)
is becomming usable.

There are a few things to consider before you make the leap though.
First (for me at least) is that you cannot get a full-speed DOS box.
What I mean is, I cannot (for instance) run Falcon 3.0 or any other
resourse intensive program in a DOS box.  It absolutley crawls.  
And my machine is a 486/33 with a 330MB HD and 16MB RAM.  If anyone
knows how to get a fast DOS box (or full-screen for that matter), 
please let me know.

The second thing is there are still not many drivers around for stuff.
For instance, my PAS-16 has been demoted to running as a Sound Blaster
(which is natively supported -- nice), because MediaVision hasn't 
produced drivers yet.

Your disk should be large enough to keep an 80MB DOS partition, and
give the rest over to Windows NT (tm).  The only thing is, whenever
you wanted to run Windows programs, you'd have to reboot and log into
Windows NT (tm), instead of just typing WIN.

Windows NT (tm) does seem to be much more stable than normal Windows
though.  It'd be a good choice if you have the resources.  You should
really have *at LEAST* 8MB RAM though.  One last thing, modems work
well enough, but I have yet to get my FAX card to work, and I've never
heard of anyone else who did either.

It's only better than UNIX because it runs killer software out of the
box, whereas with UNIX there isn't the same availablity.

I guess it comes down to -- Windows NT (tm) is not yet for the faint
of heart, it's still a beta.  But it's a very GOOD beta.

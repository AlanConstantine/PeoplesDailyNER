Hello All!

    It is my understanding that all True-Type fonts in Windows are loaded in
prior to starting Windows - this makes getting into Windows quite slow if you
have hundreds of them as I do.  First off, am I correct in this thinking -
secondly, if that is the case - can you get Windows to ignore them on boot and
maybe make something like a PIF file to load them only when you enter the
applications that need fonts?  Any ideas?

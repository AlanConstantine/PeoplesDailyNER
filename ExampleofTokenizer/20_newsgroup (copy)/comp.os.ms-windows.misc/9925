I am not sure whether I am here in the right area, but does 
anybody here know whether Windows NT does/will include a X 
Windows server so that it can run X Window applications 
remotely? This is because we are considering at our university 
to use PC's for word processing and program development, 
whereas the bigger jobs are to be run either on SUN 
workstations or on Fujitsu super computers.
 
Thank you very much in advance,
Hein.

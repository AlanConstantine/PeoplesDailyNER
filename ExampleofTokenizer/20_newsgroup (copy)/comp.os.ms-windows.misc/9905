Do you mean the icons _of_ the program groups, or the icons of the
individual programs _in_ the program groups?  I assume you mean the
latter, and the answer is: sure you can.  Just click once (not double)
on the application icon, then Alt-F P (File | Properties).  Click on the
Change Icon box and tell it the icon filename.  Or use the Browse
sub-selection.

I use Alt-Tab.  Hold the Alt key and repeatedly press Tab until you see
Program Mangler up.  Then release the Alt key.

English is my native language and I love it.  But don't try to tell me
that it's easy to learn or that it makes sense.  If it were, "baseline"
would rhyme with "vaseline".

I am using DOS Quick C 2.5 in a DOS window under Windows 3.1, and the other
day while I was running the compiler, I got a general protection fault
immediately followed by a "serious disk error".  When I rebooted, I found
that about 15 files had gotten "cross-linked" which is a pretty serious
corruption of the hard drive file system.

I am concerned that Quick C in a DOS window has somehow strayed outside
its protected mode world and corrupted the smartdrv.exe disk cache and
that is what caused the disk problem.

I thought that DOS programs run in DOS windows were pretty well-contained 
by Windows.  If that is true, then maybe the Quick C compiler has nothing 
to do with it.  Has anybody else had this type of problem?

(I only recently "upgraded" from Quick C 2.0 to 2.5.)

This may work, but won't it involve invoking the applications, e.g. if you
drag a .bmp or .txt file to the min. Print Manager icon, won't it RUN
Notepad and Paintbrush before printing?  If you just want to drag a file
(.txt or .bmp) to a print server icon, with stay at front attributes, you
need an intelligent Print Manager drag and drop client like Amish Print 2.0.

Word for Windows lets me designate text as being in a language other
than US English.  (Alt-F L, Format | Language, as I recall.)  So I mark
it for English (UK), but it still accepts "rumor" and squawks at
"rumour".  As far as I can see, Microsoft didn't include the English
(UK) dictionary on my disks.  (I don't mean to imply that I was singled
out; I assume that nobody in the U.S got them.)  I dialed the Microsoft
BBS, but nothing in the Word for Windows section looked helpful.

Can anyone tell me where or how to obtain the UK spelling dictionary for
Winword 2.0?  The file name would be SPELL_UK.LEX or something similar.

Email please; I'll post a summary.

English is my native language and I love it.  But don't try to tell me
that it's easy to learn or that it makes sense.  If it were, "baseline"
would rhyme with "vaseline".

Has anyone else observed this behaviour and if so, what have you
done to cure it?

One workstation in a WfW network goes deaf to any form of communication from
other workstations until it goes out on the network itself. From then on other
workstatons can interact with it until some time later when it goes deaf 
again. 

The workstation is set up to share its discs etc. The machine
is a 486DX/33, 8MB RAM, with Diamond Stealth video.  It behaves this
way with a variety of 16 bit network adapters, including a SMC Elite.
It also behaves the same way if I use the Windows VGA driver, rather
than the Diamond drivers.

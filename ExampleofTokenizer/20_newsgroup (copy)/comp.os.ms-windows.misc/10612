It certainly smacks of that! Remember the "POLL" that you quoted saying that
you had seen a 95% of users being satisfied with DOS 6.0? Care to recall how
unbiased the sample set was? That post sure looked like FUD....and coming
from a microsoftie .... well, it sure seemed like something was not on level.

Advocacy is GOOD - but spreading FUD to advocate your favorite OS is very 
unethical - especially when you have a vested interest in the success of that
OS.

That is because their actions seem to invite this opinion - never seen more 
defensive people in my life. Moreover, many of their posts seem to encourage
this too, IMHO.

Seriously speaking, it is a shame that MS techie employees get the heat for
MS's actions - most of which are perpetrated by the Management and marketing.
I am sure that they ARE very talented etc ... I have not doubts about their 
abilities, just about the ethics of their marketing practices.

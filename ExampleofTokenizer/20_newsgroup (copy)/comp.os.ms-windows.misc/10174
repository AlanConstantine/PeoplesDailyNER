PhaNG, the Philadelphia Area NEXTSTEP User Group, will be holding a public  
sneak preview of NEXTSTEP for Intel Processors.

Where: David Rittenhouse Labs Room A1
       33rd And Walnut, southeast corner, Philadelphia PA
When:  Wednesday, May 5th
       7 pm to 9 pm
			 
			 
NEXTSTEP is the 32 bit UNIX based operating environment which has, until now,
only been available on Motorola-based NeXT computers. In the May 11th issue
of PC Magazine called NEXTSTEP a "Hot Prospect". Now, NeXT is nearing release
of a version of NEXTSTEP which will run on 486-based PC's, yet is identical to
the 68040 version. In fact, NEXTSTEP 3.1 includes the ability to easily 
compile a program into a single binary which will run on both Intel and
Motorola hardware.

NEXTSTEP 3.1 for Intel Processors will be demonstrated on an Epson Progression
486 computer. NEXTSTEP is scheduled for release on May 25 at NeXTWorld Expo
in San Francisco.

The demonstration will be open to the public. Come one come all! If you are  
interested in seeing the most advanced PC operating system around, come on by!

For a brief summary of what NEXTSTEP offers, see the May 11th issue of 
PC Magazine, page 66.

"The experience of programming Windows vs. the experience of  
programming NeXTStep is like going to the dentist and having a root canal  
without anaesthetic vs. going to the dentist and having your gums cleaned  
w/some nitrous-oxide thrown in for the entertainment side of things."

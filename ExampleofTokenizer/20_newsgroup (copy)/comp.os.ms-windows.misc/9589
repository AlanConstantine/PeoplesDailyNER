It certainly is multi-user. What I have seen from the March Beta is
that it doesn't yet come with the stuff which exploits multi-user
features. I remember somebody from MS stating that it doesn't allow
two users share one GUI. My interpretation of this was that one user
per console but all the networking and RPC based stuff you want. 

I believe ftp and rlogin deamons for NT systems will come from third
party. Somebody already has a Beta version of an unsecure ftpd on the
net. There is no reason why one cannot write a posix based shell like
csh on Unix for remote logins. 

In general I liked NT when I checked it out. It slow compared to
Win3.1 (just like any other real OS). The beta version, although being
slow, botts up much faster than my SUN workstation. Windows subsystems
also start up a lot faster than X windows. I believe Bill Gates was
right when he stated that NT was not for everybody. After playing
around with it for a while I was convinced. If I owned a busines using
a "business computer" from IBM or some other established vendor, I
would consider moving to NT platform because it would provide a much
cheaper solution (If you are running SQL servers etc.). It provides
the robustness such an application requires. 

On the other hand if you like your DOS games, more or less forget
about NT. You can always boot to DOS  but in general that defeats
the purpose of using NT. Most of NT's features are visible in a
networked environment and in such an environment you can't reboot your
machine at will. For personal use, I would rather wait for the Win32
based Windows release (whatever you name it) than jump to NT bandwagon.
I expect most applications will keep on using Win16 until Win32
becomes widely available.

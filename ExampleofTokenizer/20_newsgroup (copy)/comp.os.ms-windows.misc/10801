You can't customize a command line interface?  Where have you been?  I
can change the prompt, I can make aliases (so someone like me who is
used to say, ls, can type it on my dos machine and still get a
directory listing), and under Unix, if I don't like the command line
interface, I throw it out and get a different one. (csh, bash, ksh,
sh, etc...)

This is true.

A decent GUI for all variations of Unix? Lessee... what about Motif?
Or the stuff from MIT? (twm comes to mind...) those are pretty
standard. Heck, an xwindows program runs like it likes to -- all the
end user has to really know is how to manipulate the actual windows
with the mouse, and since it is a GUI, it's *graphical* and a bit
easier to figure out. (Something the windows people have been pressing
down our throats for some time now...)

The thing I fear is that there will be a gap between the normal users
running windows (all flavors) and the other "power" users running Unix
and other more advanced OSes. At least right now, DOS is still pretty
much king. I can bring a copy of my latest whiz-bang programming demo
over to my friends house, and since we both run DOS, he can enjoy it
too.

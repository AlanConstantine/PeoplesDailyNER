Hi,

I use a PC with a screen access program (IBM Screen Reader) and a
speech synthesizer. (Accent SA).

I would like to find out about screen access programs for the windows
platform.  I heard that were a couple of them out now under beta
testing, I would like to find out addresses/prices etc.

Thanks,

--Raman

*** THIS IS LONG ***

I have 16MB of memory on my 386SX (25 MHz), an Intel math coprocessor, and
a 120MB hard drive with 20MB free (no compression).  I have been running
Mathcad 3.1, under Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode, with a 5MB RAM drive,
2MB/1MB Smart drive, and no swap file (permanent or temporary) for
several months.

I am interested in the faster Mathcad 4.0, but I am concerned about reported
swap file requirements and the legitimacy of Mathsoft's claim about increased
speed.

TO 386SX USERS:

  Will Mathcad 4.0 run without a swap file, or insist that I use a swap file?

So far, in response to a less detailed description of my setup, or in
unrelated postings, the more informed answers, on the net or by E-mail,
appear to be:

* So it seems that in addition to the system requirements shown on Mathsoft's  *

* Looks like I would just need an 8MB swap file, and would need to choose (or  *

* Apparently a Win32 subsystem ships with Mathcad 4.0 - how much disk space    *
* does this require?                                                           *

I also received these answers:

  1) by mfdjh@uxa.ecn.bgu.edu (Dale Hample) >>

   >> If you've got 16 megs of RAM, why not configure 10megs as a ram disk for
   >> Mathcad?  DOS 6 permits different bootup configurations.

* Can Mathcad 4.0 + Win32 be configured to use such a RAM drive instead of a   *
* swap file?  If not, I don't see how using DOS 6.0 for an alternate bootup    *
* would provide Windows with this swap file.   Some time back I remember a     *
* discussion about the issues of using a RAM drive to support a swap file,     *
* but I thought this involved slower, < 8MB systems.                           *
*                                                                              *
* I have DOS 6.0 but for various reasons have not yet done a full installation.*

* By the way, is a full installation of DOS 6.0 required to avail oneself of   *
* the "alternate bootup" feature?  Which files from the installation disks are *
* required?                                                                    *

Do you mean that the Pentium is better than a Risc?  or that it will outsell
them all?  If the first, you have to remember that intel CISC (like the
pentium) are a always a generation away from the best riscs... also Riscs
cpu are more costly because they are not sold in the same quantities (not
even on the same order)...  but I remember reading about 3 years (maybe 2)
about a T800(?) from hypercube that did a 100 mips, was superscallar AND
reordered its instruction itself so

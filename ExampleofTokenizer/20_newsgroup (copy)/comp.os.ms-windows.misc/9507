Just a thought on resources,  It is very important if you do use a
multiplatform toolkit to check on how it uses resources.  I have
used Glockenspeil commonview under Motif and OS2.  I wrote a resource
converter from OS2 to Motif, but it really wasn't too easy, especially
the naming scheme. In Motif you cannot rename controls/widgets.
With windows you can call the OK button ID_OK in every instance,
this doesn't work for Motif, you'd have to call it Dialog1_OK,
and Motif expects a text string rather than a number.  So 
your constructor should know how to convert a #define into the
proper resource identifier.
I'd check on how the toolkit expects names, and that if it does
use resources, that is uses resources for all platforms you intend to
port to. ( By the way, I would never use CommonView or Glockenspiel
for anything )

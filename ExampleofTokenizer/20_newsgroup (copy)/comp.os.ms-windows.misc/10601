Seen from a typographically point of view, ATM using PostScript fonts
is better than TrueType; the hinting mechanism incorporated in PS is
gorgeous.
Multilingual users may see the limit of possible different characters in
a PS font as problematically; they may have better use of the Unicode
features of TT fonts (in Windows NT).

I've seen *lots* of really beautiful and printable-in-small-size PS fonts;
I haven't seen those as TT fonts. Most of them are rendering quite
inaccurate (in small sizes, esp. as screen fonts).
Simply compare TimesNewRoman as a PS font with the TT font; the first
looks better.

I am hoping that there will be ATM/NT !

I would like to change all of the system fonts in windows... I have a 
program that will generate system fonts from truetype, but i was 
wondering if there is a problem to help you set up all your system
fonts.

Also, how do i change the icon text color... all of my icon text is black,
and i want to change it... couldn't find any options in control panel or
in win.ini

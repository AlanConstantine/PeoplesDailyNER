Hi.  My last question for the year.  I have a mail-order no-name notebook
with 4 meg ram.  I never have problems with my huge ramdisk or when
running desqview, but Win3.1 and W4W2.0 constantly crash on me, most
commonly citing a "memory parity error."  The only thing I can do is TURN
OFF and re-boot.  My CMOS ticks off & counts all the memory every startup,
and there is never a problem with this either.

Could it be a bug in my Windows copy instead of the hardware?  I remember
having some disk error problems when installing it.


Is there any change I could make to lessen the frequency or likelyhood of
this happening (I think win vs win /s produce different crashes, but both
crash frequently nonetheless)

I know this is a pain, but PLEASE answer by EMAIL because my home account
doesn't have rn.  And I will stop asking questions now.  Thank you.

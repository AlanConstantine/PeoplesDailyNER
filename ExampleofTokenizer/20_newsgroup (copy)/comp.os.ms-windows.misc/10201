  Well, I've come into some money and want to buy CD-ROM, sound board
and speakers.  I have not kept up on any material relating to sound
boards and CD-ROM's because until now I never thought I'd have enough
money.  

  So can you guru's out there point me in the direction of a good
package including CD-ROM, sound, and speakers (and software I
suppose)... OR since I don't REALLY need the CD-ROM right now give me
some good ideas for sound boards and speakers.  Those I could REALLY
use now.  I have looked at SoundBlaster Pro, which costs about as much
as I think I want to spend on a board (~$120), and I've looked at the
Gravis Sound board, which is about $140 and I don't know the
adv/disadv of either of these boards.  

  Right now I want to use it with any games that support sound, and to
use in Windows 3.1 to utilize sound capabilities there.  So any
concise info on sound boards, complete multimedia packages, etc would
be greatly appreciated.  If anyone else is interested in this info I
would be glad to summarize responses and post.  

  And if this is some type of FAQ please point me in the right
direction and don't bother taking up a lot of bandwidth.  Thanks!

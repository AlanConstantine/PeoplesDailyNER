ok, i have a 486dx50(ISA) w/ Diamond Stealth VRAM 1MB.
I was really satisfied w/ its performance in windows.
but now more and more games needs higher frame rates in DOS' VGA,
especially this new Strike Commander. ;-)
this stealth vram can only give me 17.5 fps. ;-( (i use 3dbench).
my winmark was 6.35 million, i think.

so right now i'm considering to replace it w/ a new card, which hopefully
can perform approx same w/ my current VRAM in windows and also
can perform DOS' VGA preferably >30fps.

i also saw the 3dbench benchmark list from someone who compiled it
in csipg and it looked that SpeedStar 24X and Orchid Prodesigner 2d-s
ware the fastest for non local bus motherboard.
both can give >30fps in DOS' VGA w/ 486dx2/66.
Does anyone have a winmarks for both of those cards above with the processor
type ? which one is the worthiest(not necessarily fastest)?
any other card recommendation is welcomed too.

also, if possible, where can i get 'this' card for the cheapest? ;-)

thanks in advance, folks!

	I'm looking for a program that will let me use a windows
common dialog box to select a file to use when running a DOS app.

	Basically, I have several DOS apps that I use now and then
with different files.  They all accept a file as a command line 
parameter, but the only way (at least that I know of) to do this
easily when running them from windows is to set up the PIF file so
that it prompts me for additional parameters (at which point I type 
in the file name).  

Problems are:

	1) Sometimes I can't remember where the file is exactly located and it
would be nice to browse my directories for it without having to use the
file manager.
	
    and 2) I'm lazy and hate to type long pathnames for files burried 
several directory levels deep.

	If anyone can point me to such a program or let me know of some
other way to handle this, I'd appreciate it.

Thanks,

Tim

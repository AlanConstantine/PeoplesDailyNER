Here's the situation:

At home, I have MS Word for windows but no printer.  At work, I
have windows + a postscript printer, but not MS Word.  So, I
configure my machine at home to use a postscript printer, and use
the print to file option, which produces a nice postscript file,
which I then bring to work.

My question:  how do I print this postscript file through the print
manager at work? If, for example, I select print from the file
manager, it treats the postscript as a text file, and gives me
several pages of postscript gibberish.

I know that I can open a DOS window and do:

	 copy file.ps com1:

which does work, but seems not to multitask very well -- other applications
run rather slowly and often pause for 10's of seconds.

There ought to be a way of passing the postscript file to the Print
Manager, but if there is, I can't find any mention of it in the
documentation.

Anyone know how to do this?

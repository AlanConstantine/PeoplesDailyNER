	First of all, without wanting to sound nagging and bossy, yes it is
a trivial answer and that's perfectly fine ( otherwise how is one supposed
to move up to the complicated and challenging questions, we net readers so
much enjoy :) ?), and the massive crossposting of your article was not
 justified...
Please refer to appropriate newsgroups next time (by the way c.o.msw.misc is
OK :) ). Now as far as your problem is concerned: try playing around with
the settings in the 'Fonts..." dialog box under the window control menu (that
little square at the top left corner of the window..).

Hey, sounds great. Does that mean that W4WG works with ODI? I thought it    
uses NDIS.                                                                  
                                                                            
My problem is that Lan Workplace with all its drivers uses up most of my    
UMBs, so I'd hate to have to load many more drivers to make W4WG work       
along.                                                                     
                                                                           
I read in a German computer magazine that TCP/IP support for W4WG is just  
around the corner. Anybody have any news about this?                       
                                                                           
Regards, Richard

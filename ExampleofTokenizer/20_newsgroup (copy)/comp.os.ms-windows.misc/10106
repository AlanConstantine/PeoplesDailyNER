I friend of mine installed dos6 at work and is hooked up to a Novell
network, running Netware 386 v.3.11.  The problem he's having is that the
doublespace program is using drive 'h' as the swap drive, which is
confliting with the networks mapped drives.

Is there switch to place the swap drive to someother drive?
Please e-mail....thanks a bunch!!

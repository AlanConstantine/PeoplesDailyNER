I just installed a new TrueType font under MS-Windows 3.1
but though all the applications display the font correctly on the
screen, quite a few of them fail to print out the document correctly
(on a LaserJet 4 - non-PostScript printer).

When I use the font in CorelDRAW, the document prints correctly, so I assume
CorelDRAW knows that the font has to be downloaded to the printer.

But when I use the Windows accessory Write, the printer prints square
boxes in place of the characters of the new font. Yet, Write does
display the font correctly on the screen.

I looked through all the Windows and LaserJet manuals, but got nowhere.
All of them just make the statement that TrueType fonts will print
exactly as you see them on the screen---so I assume Windows knows that a font
has to be downloaded automatically---but, how to make it do that????

Appreciate any help....

Greetings!
   
I've had a bunch of problems with the 24x.  Opening a DOS window on the
desktop can occasionally result in the windows "blowing up" into a set of
horizontal lines, hashing the entire desktop.  Nothing can recover this 
except to completely exit from Windows.  The other irritating problem is
that windows that scroll often overwrite lines rather than actually
scrolling, as if a CR was printed without an LF.  This seems ONLY to happen
to communications programs, but I can't nail it down any further than that.
Note, though, that the comms programs don't have to be communicating.  Even
just scrolling back through capture buffers or displaying disk files in
these programs causes the problem.
   
   Prior to the latest rev of Word Perfect for Windows, WPwin would sometimes
blow up, and the error message would cite the video driver as the source of
the problem.  I've still seen this, but only once or twice with WPwin 5.2.

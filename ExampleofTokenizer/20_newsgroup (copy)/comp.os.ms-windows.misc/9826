} Very simple.  You have to have the MOUSE.COM or MOUSE.SYS loaded in DOS
} before you run Windows.  Note that you don't need to have these files loaded
} to use the mouse in Windows.


... and you need a video driver which is completely Windows 3.1 compatible, and
your mouse driver has to be completely compatible as well.  Not quite so simple.
(I never could get my logitech mouse to work 100% in a DOS window with my
old Paradise card:  now I have a Diamond SS24X and the 6.2 mouse drivers, and
everything works perfectly).

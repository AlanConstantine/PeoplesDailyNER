InfoWorld (April 26, 1993 issue) has two articles about problems with DOS
6.  A 'Second Look' article calls it a 'loaded gun' and that people
should exercise extreme caution if they decide to use it.  The point out
that DoubleSpace and MemMaker are both problem areas that will cause a
number of folks problems.

MS's response was to the effect that there had been no problems reported
that they could duplicate (probably are not trying too hard).

Cringely reports that a lot of folks are getting/going to get burned
on the 900 support lines - his example was a call that cost $67.50, 
for 3 minutes of tech support after 25 minutes on hold.  I want to see
the MS spin doctors explain this.

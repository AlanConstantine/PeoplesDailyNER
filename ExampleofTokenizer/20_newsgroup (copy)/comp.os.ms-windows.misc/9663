: Hi,

: If you have developed your own windows application you must have a 
: SDK of some sort that contains the HC.EXE or HC31.EXE file to 
: compile and generate .HLP files out of .RTF files.

****------->  No, U can download what??.zip from ftp.cica.indiana.edu
              This package from MS is all U need to buid (simple?) .HLP
              files from Rich Text Format Files (.RTF). This package
              also contains .DOT tamplates for MS Word4Win.
 
: RTF files are generated by a wordprocessor like Word for Dos or W4W.

: If this is not the solution be more specific about your application.

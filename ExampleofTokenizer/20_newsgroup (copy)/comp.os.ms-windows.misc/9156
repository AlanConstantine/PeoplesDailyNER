Windows Shareware Monthly (WSM) is an on-line forum for information about the
newest and best Windows 3.x and NT shareware/freeware software. 

WSM is a compilation of submissions from shareware/freeware authors in a single
Windows .HLP (Help System) file.  All types of software may be submitted for
entry in WSM - utilities, applications, games, programming tools, etc.

WSM benefits Windows shareware/freeware authors by allowing them to publicize
their software releases, inform users of updated versions, and to increase
their installed base of users.  Those searching for specific Windows software
will benefit by having a complete list of available software available at their
fingertips - complete with feature lists, current prices, and any other
relevant information.

Windows software authors may submit entries to Windows Shareware Monthly in the
following manner:

1. Compose a short summary of the function of the software.  Include all
   special features which are unique to your product and which set it apart
   from other programs in the genre.  Be sure to include specific details
   such as: the current release version, where the software is available,
   how much the registration fee costs, how much disk space is required, any
   special requirements (e.g. sound card, or VBRUN200.DLL, etc.), how the
   author may be contacted, etc.  Because text is highly compressible, the
   summary may be as long as is necessary, however, it is best to keep it
   short.  A good guideline is a single screenful of 12-point text at 640x480
   resolution.  Order forms and other such addendum may be included if desired.
   All submissions whould be in plain text (ASCII) format.  Formatting will
   be exactly as it is submitted - I will simply cut and paste text files
   into a Help Authoring system.  If you require special formatting 
   conventions - such as boldface text or italics, or a larger font size,
   indicate so CLEARLY within the text file.  For best results, use Windows
   NotePad to create the .TXT file. 
 
2. Include up to 100k of Windows-format .BMP (bitmap) screen-shots which
   display the workings or special features of each program.  Special cases
   (rendering applications for example) which require 256-color bitmaps may
   submit up to 250k of .BMP files - all other should observe the 100k limit
   and use 16-color format.  For maximum compatiblity with the software which
   will be used to create the WSM .HLP file (Stefan Olson's Help Writer's
   Assistant for Windows), please save the bitmaps with Windows Paintbrush or
   WinGIF. 

3. Include a 16-color .BMP of the program's icon (.ICO file).  Many programs
   are available to convert .ICO to .BMP format, or Windows Paintbrush may be
   used.  The .BMP will be embedded in the summary text.

4. Double-check for spelling errors, formatting corrections, etc.  

5. Compress the .TXT file, the .BMP of the program icon, and any additional
   .BMPs into a single file using PKZIP (any version).

6. Submit the entry by UUENCODING the .ZIPfile, and e-mailing it to:
   
   DAA7365@TAMUTS.TAMU.EDU

   if submitting via the Internet or Compuserve. If submitting via America
   Online, send a brief message indicating submission, and append the .ZIP
   file, then e-mail to:

   DiegoAA

7. If any changes are required, or a new version is released, complete
   the above procedures again.  Send all submissions to the @TAMUTS address,
   and any comments, suggestions, criticisms, to DAA7365@RIGEL.TAMU.EDU.

All entries received before the deadline will be included in the subsequent
edition of WSM.  The editor will not be held responsible for any errors, and
we reserve the right to make changes to the entries.

WSM is not limited to shareware/freeware software.  A special area will be
devoted to commercially available Windows 3.x and NT software.  Commercial
software authors should follow the same steps above, with the exception of
the limitations on size - the .TXT file and .BMPs may be as large as required
(and as large as is practical for transmission over phone lines).  There
is no charge for the publishing of either shareware/freeware or commercial
product entries.  

Advertisements for computer hardware, software, bulletin boards, etc. may
be submitted as well. Again, the same procedures apply, with the exception of
the size limitations.  There is no charge for advertising space.  The first
ten advertisements submitted each month will be included; subsequent
submissions will not be included due to size constraints.

WSM is currently looking for persons willing to devote the time to author
columns within WSM.  A C/C++ programing section, a Visual Basic section, and
two Windows-specific opinion/advice columns are envisioned.  All work will
be on a voluntary basis.  If you wish to aid WSM and author a monthly column
on one of the above topics, please send us mail at DAA7365@TAMUTS.TAMU.EDU or
DiegoAA on America Online.
 
The first edition of WSM will be distributed May 1st via America Online,
Compuserve, and the Internet.  The deadline for submissions is April 28th.
The first edition filename will be WSM-1.ZIP, with each subsequent monthly
release continuing in the series naming convention (WSM-2.ZIP, etc.).  Each
edition will be released on the first of each month, and the deadline for
submission will be at least three days before release.

If you install the Soundblaster windows drivers correctly, and have
the latest drivers, the media player should be setup to play files
authored to Microsoft's Multimedia midi authoring standard (General
Midi), see the section in the back of the Voyetra manual in the
Soundblaster midi upgrade kit.
You'll find that midi files exist with all kinds of different
mappings, so don't expect them to always sound correct without using
some kind of midi file editor, such as Voyetra's Sequencer Plus.

You can attempt to use the midi-mapper to remap the patches for
soundblaster, but since you cannot modify the sbfm.drv you are allways
stuck with the instruments that come with this driver.  Unless you can
find an editor for making modifications to the instrument settings in
sbfm.drv , I would suggest you locate the early version of
soundblaster drivers that were mapped to mt32 voices, and the later
drivers that are mapped to the general midi voices.

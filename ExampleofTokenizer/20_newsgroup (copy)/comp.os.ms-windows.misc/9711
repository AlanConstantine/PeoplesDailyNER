Well, in the latest Windows magazine, there is an advertisement for a program
that will help you uninstall windows apps from your harddisk (Uninstaller)
but it can be used to update a network, but only for deleting, not adding
or changing their *.ini files.  (Uninstaller, by MicroHelp Inc.  $79
1-800-922-3383)

I am also looking for an *.ini updater for my PC network, and so far without
any luck.  So for the time being I have been pushing DOS and it's batch
language to its limit...look into DOS 5.0's (I am assumming that DOS 6.0
has the same command, maybe even more..or less..improved) REPLACE command.
I use this to update our users personal files with a master set in a batch
file that is run everytime they invoke Windows.  This basically overwrites
their color schemes, but does what I need it to do.  Not neat, but does
the job...I'm looking for a better solution though.

Just relaying what I know...a not for profit service.

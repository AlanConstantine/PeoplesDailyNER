There's a program called "Icon Frightener" included with the book Stupid
Windows Tricks by Bob LeVitus and Ed Tittel (Addison-Wesley, 1992).  It's
freeware.  If it's not on the net anywhere, I'll happily email a copy to
someone who's willing to upload it (I can't upload through our Internet
firewall).

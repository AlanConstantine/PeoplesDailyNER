Does anyone know the phone and fax number of the Asymetrix
Corporation. I am also interested in their e-mail address.

I would also like to know what the current status of their product Toolbook
is. I received the last update 1.5 about 1.5 year ago. Are their any new
developments or is Toolbook slowly dying?

Regards,

Rob de Winter.

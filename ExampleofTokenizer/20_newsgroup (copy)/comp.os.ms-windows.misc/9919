This should be in the FAQ, it only get asked about twenty times a month

There is *NO*, that's right, *NO* telnet access to Compuserve, no ftp access,
no gopher access....no Internet services except e-mail.

You can telnet to hermes.merit.edu, but that routes you through Sprintnet,
which is horrendously expensive.

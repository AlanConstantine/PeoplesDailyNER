Hi!  I will like to know if there is a FORTRAN library for MS-Windows v3+ out
there.

I have several lots of source code written by past A/Ps in MS-FORTRAN, and
recently have needed to port them to MS-Windows... I would like to avoid a
major code-rewrite if possible - maybe a WINDOWS library is all I need?

Please help - reply by E-mail to:  traversmorgan@swell.actrix.gen.nz

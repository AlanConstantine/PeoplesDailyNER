Are you sure you want to do that?  If a win app locks up for some reason, 
ctrl-alt-del may be the only way to kill the app and get back to Windows.  
Granted it doesn't work all that often but it has come in handy on occasion.
I consider it pretty carefully before I disabled that keystroke.  Just a 
thought.

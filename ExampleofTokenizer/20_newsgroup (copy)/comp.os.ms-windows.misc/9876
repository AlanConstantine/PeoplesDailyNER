I had this problem when I first loaded windows.  My I/O card is for 2 HD's
2 FD's 1 Parrelel 2 serial (1 for mouse and 1 for my external modem) and
a game port.  PROBLEM enters.  The DARN serial ports have no selection for 
COM settings, they are stuck on 3 and 4.  
Good card for HD's and FD's but lousy for serial. 

I called Microsoft and other places.  The long and short of it is
WINDOWS wants com1 and 2 ONLY!, for mouse selection.
I went out and bought a small I/O card just for parrelel and serial.
Now I have ALL 4 active COM ports and LPT1 and LPT2.
This Half card was less than $20.

Mouse on COM 1  external modem on COM 2,  I disabled the LPT2 so I could use
the interupt for my scanner card IRQ.

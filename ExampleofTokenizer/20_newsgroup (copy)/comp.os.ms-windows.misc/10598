	Yesterday, a friend of mine got a new driver for his card that more
than doubled the speed... Naturally, besides being a tad jealous (same 
machine -- different cards), it got me thinking... What if I am using a slow
driver? Wouldn't that be _horrible_ ? :) So netlanders, I need samples of
your collective experience (sic) -- Do you proud owners of a Trident 8900C
video card w/ 1MB VRAM have tried out more than one driver fro MS Win 3.1
which? which is the fastest? Not to be selfish, and to give you a motive
for responding, I promise I am going to collect all the answers, and the
actual drivers (provided u give me a site to get it from or uuencode&mail)
get the WinMarks using PC Magazine`s WinBENCH and... post the results here...
I am interested in SVGA drivers only (plain VGA users should run the Win
driver, or this is what I 've heard -- dont flame me!) Particularly
800x600x16 and/or 800x600x256 (that should cover the majority of SVGA users)
Well, what are you waiting for? hit that r or f or whatever...
All input welcome -- so are money and Sun SPARCstations...
Thanx in advance...

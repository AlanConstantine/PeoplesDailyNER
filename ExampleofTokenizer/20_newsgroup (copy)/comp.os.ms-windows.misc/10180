I've been using Final from CODA for some time, but suddenly it stopped using 
my fonts. I have a 386 PC with lots of disk space and memory, a Postscript 
laser, Win3.1, Finale 2.0.1 and I recently installed ATM 2.0. I've been 
fiddling around with the Windows setup for some time, and when I needed to do 
some work with Finale things didn't print properly. It might - and it might 
not - have anything to do with the installation of ATM from 1.something to 
2.0, but I don't have the old ATM lying around anomore. 

The most annoying problem was that the Petrucci font didn't print, which is a 
rather important font :-) 

I managed to get direct printing to work if I included OwnPS=0 in the 
[Finale] section of WIN.INI, but Compile PostScript Listing still doesn't 
work; and it's those .EPS files I need. When I look at the .eps files 
generated the only font which appears there is Courier. I found out that if I 
manually changed the Courier 24-point to Petrucci 24-point in the .EPS file 
everything worked ok, but I'd rather avoid that since I have a lot of songs 
to work with. 

And yes, in the Special/Font/Font names dialog box all the fonts I need are 
listed, with the correct mapping between Finale, Screen and Printer fonts. 
Finale is obviously aware of the fonts since direct printing of a score works 
well (that is, after I included OwnPS=0), and all my other Windows 
applications print Petrucci and the other fonts well. 

Has anyone encountered problems like this? 

What is the current version of Finale from Coda Music Software? I have 2.0.1

Are the people at Coda available on Internet or X.400?

I'd be grateful for all hints and help.                                -mats

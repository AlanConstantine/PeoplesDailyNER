I would like to find a Windows 3.x driver for a video board that is
based on the Chips & Technologies chipset.  The actual board is a
Scorpion Framegrabber made by Univision.  It is based on the C&T
chipset, but only barely supports the graphics mode.  I am hoping that
any C&T driver could be used in the 640x480x256 mode.

Thanks.

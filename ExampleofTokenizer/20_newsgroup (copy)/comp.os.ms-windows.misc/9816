I quit windows normally to run a special DOS app, got done with it
and tried to start windows.  Ok got the title screen, Windows
background, DOS with an error about loading PROGMAN.EXE.  Hum, yep
PROGMAN.EXE is still there.  Must be bad, ok pull off PROGMAN.EXE
from a backup tape, start windows, get the windows title screen,
windows background, DOS with the same error.  HUM!  Fire up the
good ol' Norton Disk Doctor, test, 500 lost clusters!  Ok, fix them,
and look through them, doesn't look important.  Remove the Windows
directory, and reinstall from disks.  Fire up windows, title screen,
background, Program Manager, Success!  

I have a 486/50 (Amy) with 4 meg of RAM, 120 meg HD, SVGA, running under
DOS 5.0, no special memory managers or stuff, just the basic Windows 3.1
A 12 meg permanent swap file using 32-bit Access.  I mainly use Windows
to run more that one DOS app at a time.  (ie downloading with Qmodem
with a DOS window open, and possibly POV running in the background.)  

I've noticed that since I started using Windows a few months ago, lost
clusters have gotten more and more common.  Although I don't like
having data just disappear, it really haven't been a problem except
for today.  Has anyone else had any problems with lost clusters while
running windows?  And what could I do to fix the problem, I'd sleep
better knowing Amy wasn't loosing her marbles. :)

The original RISCs had small instruction sets, and simple ones. The
idea was that a) every instruction should be completable in a single
clock cycle and b) to have no microcode and c) extensive pipelines.

A few comparisons (from Patterson: Reduced Instruction set computers.
CACM V28. 1, 1985):

CPU		Year	Instructions	Microcode
---		----	------------	---------
IBM 370/168	1973	208		420Kb
DEC VAX 11/780	1978	303		480Kb
IBM 801		1980	120		0
UCB RISC 1	1982	39		0
Stanford MIPS	1983	55		0

While researching for the VLSI VAX, DEC discovered that 60% of the VAX
microcode is there to support 20% of the instruction set which
accounted for a mere 0.2% of all instructions executed. The uVAX 32
subsetted the architecture onto a single chip and used a software
emulator for these very complex instructions, the full VLSI uVAX
included the entire instruction set, was 5-10 times more copmlex but
only ranm 20% faster.

CPU		Chips	Microcode	Transistors
---		-----	---------	-----------
uVAX 32		2	64K		101K
VLSI uVAX	9	480K		1250K

I installed Windows for Workgroups on my network and I'm having problems 
mapping drives in the file-manager.

Situation:
If I put LASTDRIVE = Z in my config.sys, NETX will run but I can't access
drive f: to log in to Novell.  
If I don't put LASTDRIVE = Z in my config.sys I can't access other W4WG 
drives from the file-manager.

It seems that there should be a way to make NETX work with the LASTDRIVE = 
statement in my Config.Sys.

I would appreciate any help.  It's probably an easy problem that all you 
Windows guru's solved many many moons ago...

Thanks,
Tom Bilan

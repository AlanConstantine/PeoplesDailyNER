Hey folks!

Just moments ago, I uploaded the Bungee Jumper After Dark module that
was widely talked about on here some time ago.

It's at ftp.cica.indiana.edu, in /pub/pc/win3/uploads, titled simply
bungee.zip.

Be sure to set your ftp connection to binary mode before downloading.
If you have any other After Dark shareware/freeware modules, please
upload them too.  The more the merrier.

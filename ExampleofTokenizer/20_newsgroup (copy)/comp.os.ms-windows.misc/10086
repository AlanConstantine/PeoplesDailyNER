Do you mean a prog. that doesn't jump to the DOS display and then back or 
create a temp. DOS window?

If yes then I might recommend WinZip from ftp.cica.indiana.edu.  I'm afraid 
I don't have the file name or version but you should be able to find it.

It's fully compatible with ver. 2.04g and very functional.

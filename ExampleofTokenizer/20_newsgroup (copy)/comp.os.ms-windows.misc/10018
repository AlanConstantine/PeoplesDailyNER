I had this problem when I initially installed my sound blaster pro and here's
what the tech support told me.

They told me to look for the files that are stated in the readme file from
the win31 subdirectory of the soudblaster directory. Now look in the system.ini
file and if any of them say device=xxxxxxx.386 than change it to 
device=*xxxxxxx
Thats should work. Was your system.ini file erased for some reason? That would
be the only reason that I would think that Windoes is giving you the error now.

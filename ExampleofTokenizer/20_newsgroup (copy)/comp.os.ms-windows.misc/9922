Ummm.. I think you left the message out...

I get these protection faults all the time on my machine at work, a
486 33MHz with 4MB RAM, Windows 3.1, with Dos 5.0.  

At home (on a 386 40MHz, 8MB RAM, Windows 3.1 and Dos 5.0) I *never* get
these.  

Any idea what could be wrong?  Someone already suggested I check for tmp
files in the windows/temp directory, there are none there.

The message I get is:

	This application has violated system integrity due to an invalid
	general protection fault and will be terminated.

I only have this problem with applications running in DOS boxes (with or
without .pif files setup for them).

Any hints/help greatly appreciated.  Please post since at least one other
person is also having gpf problems.

Thanks,
    Gordon

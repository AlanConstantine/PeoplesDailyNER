The number you gave is the Borland BBS, and darned if I can find any
stealth drivers there!

Diamond's BBS is 1-408-730-1100 - according to the manual I got with
my Stealth-24.  I have had a bunch of trouble using the RIGHT drivers
that came with the card (locking up, de-syncing, etc.) so I hope you 
do better than I do!

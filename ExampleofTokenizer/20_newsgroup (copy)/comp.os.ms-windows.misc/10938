Sorry, I don't have the demo, but I do have the program and have been
using it for the past few weeks.  Since I now have Dos 6 as well, I
don't use many of the features of PCT4Win.  But I do so use:
	- the PCT Desktop with drag and drop printing, folders in
          folders, and multiple desktops
	- the file manager which is far superior to win 3.1's fm.

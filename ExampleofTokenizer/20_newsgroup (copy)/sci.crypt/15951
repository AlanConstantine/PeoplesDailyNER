I'm looking for a copy of Friedman's Riverbank Publication No. 16 "Methods
for the Solution of Running-Key Ciphers."  Agean Park Press tells me that their
publication C-23 "The Riverbank Publications, Volume 1" is out of print.  Can
anyone snail-mail me a photocopy of No. 16?  If someone could it would be much
appreciated.

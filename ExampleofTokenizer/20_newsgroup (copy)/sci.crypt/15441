At first I was going to complain that your analogy was completely
irrelevant.  But then I remembered something.

Remember that move to get the U.S. to the metric system all those
years ago?  As far as I know we were supposed to be there by now.

The government sold it as better for the people, easier to be in
tune with the rest of the world.  They had decided it was for
our own good.

Then, when the plan was released, it soon became apparant that the
government were a bunch 'o' thickies.

Think about it, change all the railroad track widths, signs,
screws, abolish the old regime.

At the cost of millions of dollars.

Your point is well taken.  You think there is nothing to worry
about, you could care less who designs your cryptography, any
more than who designs your screws or the system of measurement
you use.

Sit back, that's right, just relax, we'll take care of all your
needs Mr. Molitor.

Preventing black market chips w/non-escrowed keys IS exactly what they
mean by protecting the security of the key escrow system.  There are
two parts to the security of such a system:
  
    (a) Preventing decruption by unauthorized personel
    (b) Assuring that the gummit can always decrypt clipper
        traffic when it authorizes itself to do so.

Of course, the ministry of propoganda will do a lot of tallking about
(a) and very little about (b).

ps: Anyone care to guess what encryption scheme the gov't is using on
    its newly formed database of anarch-cryptists who oppose this entire
    lunacy?

And since Clinton is also going full-bore to deny unconnected citizens
the means to defend themselves ("we will protect you ... 911 is good
enough for you...") by perverting or trashing the Second Amendment,
the targeted individuals will be GUARANTEED easy prey.  What is a few
bodies compared to the "greater good" of the Fed being able to defeat
a citizen's security with impunity?  You don't think there doesn't
exist a means by which the NSA can do their usual eavesdropping, scanning
for keywords, with OR WITHOUT a court order or any 'keys', do you?
If so, I got some great Florida real estate you might be interested in...

Perhaps the idea of escrowed keys is meant to divert the discussion to
how they will be safeguarded, and away from the basic fact that the
government is systematically taking away our right to privacy, to be
secure, for the means of self-defense, and just about every other right
spelled out in the Bill of Rights?

Nawwww - they are the GOVERNMENT!  "Trust us..."

<In other words, Clipper and similar systems have the potential to turn a
<current inconvenience to law enforcement into a direct, vicious, and
<persistent threat to the general public.

What is more important to the government?  Law Enforcement (people control)
or the safety of the general public?  The gun control issue should answer
that one - look at how good that works in making cities safer:  The places
that are the worst in that regard are also the places with the 'best' gun
control.  Government is NOT about public good, it is about CONTROL.

Never forget that.  Our Founding Fathers sure were concerned about it.

	Again we have the trust in government problem here. Members of 
Mr. Sternlight's generation trust the government to a degree which
members of my generation find ridiculous. I would suggest that Mr. Sternlight
read about the COINTELPRO program, or about J. Edgar Hoover, or about
the wire-tapping of Martin Luther King, then, after he has digested this
information he can ponder the fact that while the government does not
tap every conversation that they have a record of tapping many conversations
that they have no right to, even under their own laws. Given the long
history of members of the US government ignoring the laws that apply
to them, it is no wonder that so many people in here sound so paranoid, and
given the fact that it is often difficult or impossible to punish these
individuals once they are discovered, it is no wonder that so many people
in here have so little faith in the escrow proposal for Clipper.

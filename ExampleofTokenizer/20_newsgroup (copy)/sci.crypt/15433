Read the Constitution yourself.  The Second Amendment says the right to bear
arms shall not be infringed, so a well regulated militia may be more easily
formed.  I have an interpretation of the Second that shows there are no 
qualifications to the right to keep and bear arms.  If you want, I can E-mail
it to you.  By the way, gun talk belongs in talk.politics.guns.

Me too. A tendency on the part of some people to hide their head in
the sand.

How many people do you want jailed for their convictions, for their
insistence on real privacy? Why sit by quietly while the preconditions
for a real civil war are put in place by a short-sighted government.

right to free speech.

Perhaps you should talk to the government about that. Or are you a
disciple of David "The cops are our FRIENDS" Sternlight?

The implied threat of the illegalization of private crypto, the
not-so-subtle subtext of the clipper announcement, is what worries me.
I don't want my children growing up in a police state.

The message from the NIST about the clipper chip comes from the
following address:

	clipper@csrc.ncsl.nist.gov (Clipper Chip Announcement)

Just who is that, I asked myself, or rather, I asked the computer.

    % telnet csrc.ncsl.nist.gov 25

Well, isn't that interesting.  Dorothy Denning, Mitch Kapor, Marc
Rotenberg, Ron Rivest, Jim Bidzos, and others.  The Government, RSA,
TIS, CPSR, and the EFF are all represented.  I don't suppose anybody
within any of these organizations would care to comment?  Or is this
just the White House's idea of a cruel joke on these peoples' inboxes?

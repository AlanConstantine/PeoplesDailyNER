Have you heard of PGP? I assume from your post that you have not. PGP 2.2
is a freeware RSA encryption program which includes digital signatures and
comprehensive key management facilities. Most sites also keep the source code.
A growing number of people are using this excellent software to encrypt (to
a very high standard) their email and data. Get it before Clinton outlaws it.

Two of the many sites are:
      rsa.com     /pub/pgp
      soda.berkeley.edu      /pub/cypherpunks/pgp

Hope this helps,

Jon

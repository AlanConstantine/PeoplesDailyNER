Can we use murder instead of copyright violation, just to keep things
straight?  The 5th applies only to criminal cases which copyright 
infringements are not (they are civil).

P.S. I'm sorry to waste bandwidth on a quibble, I just don't want
anyone to get confused.  I think a bunch of kiddie porn GIFs make
a better test case than a bunch of Peanuts strips and that IS criminal
both in posession and distribution.

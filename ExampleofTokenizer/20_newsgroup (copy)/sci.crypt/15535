	Actually, I've been following her remarks for some time, with
interest. I'm also a member of academia, and her remarks have nothing
but elevate her respectability in my eyes. It remains to be seen whether
you are the radical fringe, or I.

	It is generally an error to assume that your beliefs are held by
the majority, or even a sizable minority. Especially when you're seeing
tens, nay dozens, of people on usenet agreeing with you.

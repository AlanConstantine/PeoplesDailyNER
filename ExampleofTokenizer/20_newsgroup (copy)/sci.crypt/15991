I want to add link encryption to a module that multiplexes upper
level routines into a single data link. The upper levels won't know
about this, and thus key exchange shall only need to occur once (at
the initial link establishment). I figure that I can do this with
DES and a Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

Is using a Diffie-Hellman exchange to establish a 64 bit DES key
acceptable, in other words, what are the pro's and con's of such a 
setup? Are there any important issues to watch out for (aside from
filtering out unacceptable keys)?

And in order to achieve this, I guess I will need to use 64bit math
routines (for probable prime number calculation, exponentiation etc),
so could someone point me towards a good package (this is strictly
non-commercial).

Matthew.

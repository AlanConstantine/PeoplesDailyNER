	This doesn't handle superencrypted traffic. If the clipper
doesn't impose any unfortunate performance side-effects there's no
reason not to use it to superencrypt a stream of triple-DES encrypted
traffic. That way your traffic looks "normal" and perhaps anyone
desiring to listen in won't even bother, since they know nobody's
going to really trust crypto that has classified internals for
important stuff.

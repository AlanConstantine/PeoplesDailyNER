Perry is right on target here. Careful analysis of the Clipper Chip
announcement reveals that is *not* likely to remain "voluntary" for
very long...the cost of the system, the cost of generating and _then
storing_ the escrow keys, and the admitted security holes pretty much
make the ClipperPhone a loser.

Strong crypto will outcompete it, if strong crypto is allowed. This is
the battle we face.

We had rumblings of this totalitarian key registration thing a while
back, and now the other shoe has dropped. The firestorm of commentary
and criticism this time around reveals the almost immediate revulsion
this Wiretap Chip (and automatic Caller ID and Callee ID, don't
forget!) generates in everyone, or almost everyone, who hears about
it.

This is a battle we can't afford to lose.

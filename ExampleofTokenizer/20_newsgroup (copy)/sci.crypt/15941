  There is a description of something called a "fair crypto system" in the
May 1993 issue of BYTE, p. 134, attributed to MIT professor Silvio Micali.

  The way it works is as follows:

  You generate your private key S, and break it up into pieces s1, s2, s3,
s4, and s5, such that (s1 + s2 + ... + s5) mod p = S.
  You give each piece s1, s2, etc. to a different escrow agency.
  The agencies each compute g^sn mod p, and forward the result to the public
key telephone book keeper.
  The public key telephone book keeper multiplies all the g^sn mod p, reduces
the result to mod p, and this will be the user's public key.

  Now, if there were several hundered recognized escrow agencies, and the user
could give a piece of the key to each of the ones he trusted, the result would
be something of an improvement over the proposed Clipper system.

  I still don't think key escrow is a good idea, for both philosophical and
security reasons, but I do offer this suggestion simply to determine whether
escrow advocates are at all interested in considering alternatives in good
faith, or whether the goal is to insure the use of only two agencies selected
for spinelessness in the face of official requests.

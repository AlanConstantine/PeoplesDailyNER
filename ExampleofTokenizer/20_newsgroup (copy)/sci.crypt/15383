As a flaming libertarian paranoid extremist (:-), I'at a loss for
specific objections that don't sound frighteningly technical.  Any
suggestions?  Perhaps somebody could post a list of these?

One way to do this might be to suggest that these companies should be
implementing their own schemes, not being limited to the govt's
scheme.

I find that most of my reasons for opposition to the CLipper scheme
are algoritm insecurity and mistrust of the govt/NSA.  These are hard 
to sell in letters to the editor and to nontechnical people.  Any
hints or advice.  Maybe a small FAQ-type thing "Why should I Hate
Clipper" would be a good idea.

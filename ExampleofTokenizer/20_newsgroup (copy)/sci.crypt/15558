Actually the govrnment is telling you that if you want to use their
"product" the manufacturer (actually better yet, some "trusted" pair
of escrow agencies) has to have the key.

Most of us already are in this situation--our car makers have keys to our
cars (or can get them quickly from the VIN  number), and I have no doubt
that if presented with a court order, they'd surrender copies to the
government.

Chances are that many locksmiths have the code numbers for house locks
they've installed, and in an emergency can cut keys; thus they'd also
provide such keys to the government pursuant to a court order.

The state has no difficulty gaining access to your safe deposit box if they
have a court order.

Bad analogy.

This is not to argue for or against the proposal, but rather better
distinctions are required in thinking about it than "house key, safe-deposit
keys, etc.".

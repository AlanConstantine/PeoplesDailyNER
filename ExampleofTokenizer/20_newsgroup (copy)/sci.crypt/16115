May I suggest that any any proposed cipher system
having less entropy than the user's key and message can have
an embedded subliminal channel as big as the
difference in entropies between the entropy of the user
input (message) and the entropy of the output?

For example, take plain DES.  The unsuspecting
user inputs a string "PLAINTEXT" to be enciphered.

He cranks the algorithm which has been hacked
by George Quisling and comes out with j*3H4902d.

Nine char in and nine chars out.  Right?

The unsepecting user ships the ciphertext
to be decrpyted and the message "PLAINTEXT"
is produced.  Everything fine, right?  Nope.


Imagine the algorithm did a LZ compression
on PLAINTEXT before DESing. (Compressing is
down to four characters with more entropy:

9#wj

The opponent now pads the message with his
own message, also compressed

*3dk@

before applying DES to the concatenated
compressed pairs.  When decrpyted, the
first compressed message is stripped off
and declared sent.  Unbeknowst to the
receiver, the opponents accomplice collects
the remaining message in the bit bucket and
uncompresses to KILL NOW.

And to prevent all such subliminal or covert
storage channels you would need to have 
maximal entropy all the time -- which is
a priori impossible because (for example)
a stereotypical message might be
replaced by one bit in the output reserving
the rest of the output bits for the long
covert message.

In other words, if you opponent get to muck
with the algorithm -- you either have got to
muck with it LAST or concede his possible 
embedding of covert channels.

In other words, if you present a message
to an opponet with less than maximal entropy
then you have given him free bits of storage.

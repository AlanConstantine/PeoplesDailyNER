  Oh, that puts the debate on -excellent- terms for our side:

  FEDS:  You people saying that Clipper is insecure don't have any real
information to support that judgment.
  ME:  Fine -- show me this "information" that would prove me wrong.
  FEDS:  That's secret!

  When it comes down to that, it looks suspiciously like some government
official pasting "TOP SECRET" stamps over embarrasing information in order
to save his own hide.  In fact, framing the secrecy issue in that perspective
is more likely to turn Joe Sixpack's suspicions against the Feds than the
Constitutional argument -- a point I urge the others on the pro-freedom
side to consider when making their case.

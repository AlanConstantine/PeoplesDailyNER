Ed, as usual, makes a very good point.

One time a friend of mine at Sun sent me an e-mail.  He composed it using the
Sun OpenWindows 3 "mailtool" which handles (non-MIME) "attachments" and the
like.

Since I don't use "mailtool", I had to manually save it, cut & paste, and
then "uudecode" the actual attachment.  What I got - after a not-inconsiderable
amount of time spent doing this - was an audio file.  The original message
was over 32Kb of mail headers and uuencoded data; the resulting audio message
was a single sentence that I transcribed as a 135 character message.

If he had sent me the sentence in plain text, the e-mail would have been
around 250 bytes, and it would have taken me about 3 seconds to process it at
most.  Instead, it was 32k and it took at least a minute.  A complete waste of
(my) time and bandwidth, as far as I'm concerned.  Sending plain text is still
the most efficient method of transmission, given the same transport mechanism.
I shudder to think what would happen if everyone started posting their Usenet
articles as audio files instead of plain text!  Meltdown of the Net predicted!
Film at Eleven!

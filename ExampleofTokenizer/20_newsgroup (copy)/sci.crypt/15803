There's an out for him.  The announcement talked about strong cryptography
I believe.  Specifically:

	nor is the U.S. saying that "every
     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an
     unbreakable commercial encryption product."

Every vendor claims his product is unbreakable -- so this was sloppy wording.

I am not claiming that we private citizens should have access to the NSA's
best, secret algorithms.  I don't want any NSA algorithms, actually.

I'll let them break my pitiful amateur algorithms -- and RSA's.

All I want is what I have already -- the ability and right to invent and use
my own algorithms, share them with my friends and sell them.

In the UK, it's impossible to get approval to attach any crypto device
to the phone network.  (Anything that plugs in to our BT phone sockets
must be approved - for some reason crypto devices just never are...)

I was wondering some time ago how big a market there was for good old-
fashion acoustic coupler technology to build a secure phone :-) ... is
it possible to mask out all the real voice well enough so that none of
it strays into the mouthpiece?  Perhaps a well-sealed coupler attachment
that was as well blocked as possible, then a white noise generator on
the outside to muffle any real speech?

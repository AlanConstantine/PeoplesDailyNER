Useful?  I find his estimate of the annual value to law enforcement
of $5 million quite useful, if rough (e.g. wiretaps may be
preferentially used on otherwise-hard-to-catch criminals, resulting
in an underestimate).  This comes to twenty cents a head over the
U.S. population.  I would find some rigorous numbers on this quite
useful -- it would make for nice slogans: "Your privacy is worth
$0.37", or whatever it turns out to be.

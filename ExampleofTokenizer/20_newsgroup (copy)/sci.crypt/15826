I believe it's legal to send DES code or equipment from the US to Canada
with no export license.  I think this is the only place you can do this - all
other countries require a license.

As an aside, I've always thought it should be legal to send DES software
anywhere, if you follow these rules:

   1.  Encrypt your DES software with DES.
   2.  Send the encrypted software to the recipient.
   3.  Send the key to the recipient.

The only way the person on the other end can use your DES software is if
he/she already *has* DES available - otherwise, they can't decrypt your
program, and it is useless.  If you've guaranteed they already have DES,
have you really violated any law by sending it to them in the form of
your program??  I'm sure it's still illegal, but it seems like a good idea...

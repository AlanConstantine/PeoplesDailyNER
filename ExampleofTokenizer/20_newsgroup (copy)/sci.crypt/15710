Mr. Ward, before you start blathering about your skill "interpreting"
the Constitution, it might be helpful to learn to read.  After a review
with a high school English teacher emphasizing participial phrases, you
might start with the Second Amendment, and follow it up with:

 97th Congress, 2nd Session, Committee Print, *The Right To Keep and
 Bear Arms*, of the Subcomittee on the Constitution of the Committee on
 the Judiciary, United States Senate, 97th Congress, Second Session,
 February, 1982.  GPO No. 88-618-O

This authoritative, heavily researched and annotated document clearly
turns your "interpretation" into specious claptrap, which is a polite
way of saying utter bullshit.  In spite of your false assertion to the
contrary, the Second Amendment DOES protect the right of the individual
citizen, in his capacity as an individual, to keep and bear arms.

And, Mr. Holland, IMHO, blatantly and harmfully false information,
asserted as fact and globally distributed, deserves globally
distributed rebuttal in the forum in which it is posted.

(And besides, this site doesn't carry t.p.g...:-)

No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.  The strongest
reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is,
as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.

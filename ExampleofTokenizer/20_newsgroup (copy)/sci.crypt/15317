I know that at least one person on that list says the first he heard
of Clipper was in the Friday morning newspaper! And another has
already fired off a letter of protest to NIST.

My point? I suspect this list, interesting as it is for various
reasons, does not represent the cabal that put this proposal together.
Some of them, yes. Others, no. 

This may be nothing more than a mailing list of people who get
crypto-related announcements from NSA, er, I mean "NIST."

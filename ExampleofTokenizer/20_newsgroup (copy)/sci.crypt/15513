I can see high-voltage type display devices being vulnerable (CRTs,
plasma displays, etc.)  But Jason beat me to this question.  What
about EM radiation from low-voltage items like LCD displays?

Perhaps the critical element is the driver circuitry?  The cabling?
What about a portable PC/Mac/etc., where all the "noise" is bunched
into one tiny area?

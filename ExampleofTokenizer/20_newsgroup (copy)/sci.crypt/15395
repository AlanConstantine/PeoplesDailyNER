I must respectfully disagree with this assertion, Brad.  The government is
notoriously sloppy with physical, communications, and information security.  They
can't keep their computers safe, and they're "trying".  Read "DEA is
Not Adequately Protecting National Security Information" [GAO/IMTEC 92-31] for an
excellent example of what I'm talking about.

Private sector organizations tend to be even more lax in their security measures.
I believe that the escrow organizations will be penetrated by foreign
intelligence services within months, if not weeks, of their selection.  Private
organizations that lack the resources of a full-fleged intelligence service will
take longer - perhaps on the order of one to two years.  Nonetheless, the
penetrations will take place, without question.

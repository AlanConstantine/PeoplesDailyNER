Depends..  Its possible that the phone sends its serial number in the
clear at some specified interval... So all a listener needs to do is
get that SN, and then get the key for it...  So swapping phones isn't
a problem (for the gov't, that is).  They still know that this line
belongs to you, so they just watch the line and see the SN, and then
they get the key for that SN...

   In either case, I think we need to look at this a bit deeper."'jbl)mW:wxlD2

Well, I think this is understood.  The major problem is that a lot of
people just don't trust this key escrow stuff, and the fact that the
algorithms are classified...  So, yes, a lot of this needs to be looked
at closer!

I believe it is illegal to send any cryptographic code out of the country
without an export license. (Others will correct me if this is inaccurate.)

Dunno if you'd get one for the particular code you have; the only way to
find out is to apply for a license.

Note that you need to distinguish between what is legal to send to Canada if
YOU have such a license, and what is legal to send if you don't.

I second the motion.

All in favor?

BTW>> a few days ago, Charles Fee <CXF111@psuvm.psu.edu> posted the names,
addresses, and phone numbers (voice and fax) of almost all the 103rd 
congress's members.  This info, along witha great number of cabinet men, etc...
I captured it, as did many others, I am sure.

We should single out a few of the people on the list, and bombard them 
with lobbying against the Clipper Chip, et al.

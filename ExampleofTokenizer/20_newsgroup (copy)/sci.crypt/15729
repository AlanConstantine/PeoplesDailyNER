(Sorry about double posting, but I forgot something.)

"make, use or sell" in this context have non-standard meanings:

"Make" means making an encrypted message.  "Use" may mean using PGP, or
using an encrypted message.  "Sell" would probably mean selling an
encrypted message.  It is the message created by a "patented" process
incorporated in PGP, which infringes.

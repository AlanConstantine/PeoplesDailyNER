It does give privacy, just not absolute privacy.  The announcement was very 
up front about this, and about allowing wiretaps.  How is this "fooling" 
anyone?

Sure.  The two don't interoperate.  You couldn't talk to, say, a Cylink phone 
from a Clipper phone.  I would expect even multiprotocal phones to come with 
indicators saying which kind of link encryption is in use...

So start a company and build them.  This is still mostly a capitalist 
economy...

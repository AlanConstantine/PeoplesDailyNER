   The serial number will be in a 64 bit block, with a 34 bit filler.  Doesn't
   take a lot to check to see if that is correct.

Depends on whether the filler is a constant (makes checking easy,
but susceptible to replay), or variable (e.g. timer, counter, random),
which makes replay harder and can also make it easier for the
inquisitors to know if they've missed messages, or gotten them out of
sequence, or other interesting things that sort of person might care about.

It is still easy to conceal super-encryption, at least until the
inquisitors get ahold of the K key, which can take a while,
presumably not in near-real-time.  (Worst-case, in which the escrow agencies
provide the U key to the local cops, still only gets one side of the
conversation per warrant, unless the same key is used for both directions,
which I suppose the CAPSTONE version of the chip will probably insist on.)

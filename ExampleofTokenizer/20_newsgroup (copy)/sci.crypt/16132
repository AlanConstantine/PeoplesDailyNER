Summary: bibliography available on request
Lines: 16

Yesterday I read an article from someone who was requesting references for
introductory texts on cryptography.  Although I marked the article to
return, it appears to have expired on this site.

Anyway, on one of the previous occasions when this subject arose I saved
a couple articles which made suggestions.  One of the articles contained
a quite impressive bibliography.  If the poster of the request (or anyone
else) would like to email me, I would be glad to send out copies of these
recommendations, including the bibliography.

The problem is, the people are not having the scope, or implicataions
pointed out to them.  Hell, most haven't even heard of Clipper, and
when they do, it will be in soothing language telling everyone how
nice the government is at 'letting them have' privacy.

How come the media is not telling about the provisions of the Clipper
decision?  The provisions of the Crime Bill?  The abuses of Civil Forfeiture?
The government uses polls to support 75 percent of the people want
gun bans, etc., yet the same pollsters have determined (according to
the media) that 30 percent of the people are unaware of what the Holocaust
is...

The people cannot be expected to give decent decisions when they are
denied the information that all these abuses and whittling away of
rights are going on quietly.  When they find out (when it hits them),
it will be too late.  One cannot expect each citizen to spend all their
time probing, searching, researching, etc.   For example, how big a
percentage of the average population even has access to USENET?  Way
less than 1 percent, I bet.   How many outside of Internet/USENET
are even AWARE of what Big Brother is doing, or have been exposed to
arguments of both sides of the issue?

What the public will get is only ONE side:  The Government's side.

THAT is scary.

How can the bulk of the people be informed, when the media refuses to

The people at large need to be informed.  BUT HOW?   I am but one person.
I try to talk to everyone that will listen, but I can hardly make any
kind of dent.

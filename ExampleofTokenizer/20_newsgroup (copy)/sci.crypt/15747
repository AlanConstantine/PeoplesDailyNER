That wasn't my point. My point is that your implied position about the "Waco
Massacre" is an assertion cum political position. According to a CNN poll,
about 86% of Americans think the FBI acted properly, and a majority think
they should have done it (the tear gas) a lot sooner. A large majority also
believe the FBI was not at all responsible for the death of the victims,
Koresh was. (Let's avoid the kind of fruitless argument of the sort If A
hadn't X'd, then B might not have Y'd....)

What you call the "Big Brother Chip" is right now a proposal under
discussion, and it is not yet clear that strong crypto is going to be
banned.

Therefore neither justifies "any tactic is fair." Thus the statement is
nonsense. It is pernicious, because "any tactic" can lead to damaging
others.

As I see you know from the tone of your reply, there's nothing personal
intended.

Hmm, my first thought was that they're using Diffie-Hellman exponential
session key exchange, or an equivalent.  However, the Diffie-Hellman
patent, like the Hellman-Merkle one on public key systems, claims
all equivalents, so the basic point stands.

Interestingly, a quote from Jim Bidzos showed up in the media real
soon after the announcement, and he sounded very pissed.  Maybe he hadn't
yet realized that PKP might have just struck gold?  All they have to
do is get someone to admit the general scheme that the Clipper uses.

Hmmm... I wouldn't consider encryption to be a weapon.  How would the
government classify encryption?  Seems to me that encryption ought to
be covered by the first amendment.   Using this line of reasoning, the
government shouldn't be able to restrict what data people encrypt and
what encryption algorithms they use because this would be restricting
one's freedom of speech.  In other words, encrypted data---text,
graphics, or other information---is just another form of free speech.
For this reason the government shouldn't be able to regulate the use
of encryption algorithms and encrypted data.  The only time the
government should be able to 'force' someone to reveal his or her
encryption keys for some encrypted data is when the encrypted data
in question may be something that isn't protected by the first
amendment such as kiddy porn.  Even in a case like this the
government should be required to get a search warrant before coercing
someone into revealing the keys.

BTW, what encryption methods are considered to be state-of-the-art
nowdays.  Have the feds relaxed export restrictions on DES yet?
Also, is DES still regarded as a good form of encryption?

Hello. I am the David Sternlight keeper of the FAQ. Unfortuantely I cannot
find it at the present time.

From the original FAQ:

Question: Does anyone take David Sternlight serious?

Fact: No one takes David Sternlight serious. They review his opinions and
in most cases immediately discard them or jerk them over to
alt.fan.david-sternlight which actually should be alt.flame.david-sternlight.

Question: Why does David continue to relate mis statements regarding
encryption and other topics?

Fact: David Sternlight has a chemical imbalance of the right side of his
brain.

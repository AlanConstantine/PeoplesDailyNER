Dear netters:

I have been scanning this news group for a while but has not found a FAQ.
Could someone enlight me where to find the FAQ if there is a one. Also,
could someone recommend a few good books about encription and decription,
about patent information, goverment regulation on this science/technology.
I will appreciate any of your help very much.

Sincerely

Bi Chen

The same could be said for many other goverment agencies, but big budgets,
large staffs, and long lead time haven't made many of them into models of
effectiveness.

The fact is that those of us outside the inner circles have only James
Bamford's word that the people at the NSA use those legendary masses of
computers for anything other than reading netnews, like many of us.

The NSA *doesn't* have an impressive record of accomplishments, at least
not a public record.

Hint 1:

: Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to
: protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to
: protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hint 2:

: This new technology will help companies protect proprietary
: information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations
: and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted
                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
: electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the

VERY BIG HINT 3:

# The Administration is committed to working with the private
# sector to spur the development of a National Information
# Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer
# technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to
# information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks
# ("information superhighways") will transmit video, images, HDTV
# programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone
# system transmits voice.

VERY BIG HINT 4: (See above)

## Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important
## role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act
## quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding

Oh, I see your point.  I think you're wrong.  But if you sit back and wait
to find out if I'm right, it'll be too late.  Just listen *very* carefully
for the first 'such and such will not be permitted on network XYZ' shoe to
drop.

For what it's worth...

I haven't been able to open an ftp session with that machine.

Operating under the assumption that the address was wrong, I tried using
nslookup and nicname/whois...

[nnsc.nsf.net]

 ncsl                           server = SUNMGR.NCSL.NIST.GOV          
 SUNMGR.NCSL                    129.6.48.12

That's all I could find about the ncsl domain...oh, and I tried an MX lookup
on the machine in question, which failed.  Nicname/whois domain lookups at
both registries failed, too. 

So I thought, "hey, I'm just not using the tools right" and tried calling
the BBS number -- no answer.

I'm probably doing something wrong...or, perhaps, the machine has been put
behind a firewall.  But it does look like csrc.ncsl.nist.gov has become an
un-machine.  If someone would try ftp'ing to it, or knows what's up, I'd
really appreciate the info.

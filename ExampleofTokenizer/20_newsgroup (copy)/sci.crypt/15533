I find this a very disturbing view!  Yes, we DO care about EVERYONE's
privacy... Even if "they" don't know it. What happens if the gov't
starts creating legislation such that the Clipper and such
technologies become the only "legal" encryption forms?  What happens
when the Clipper is the *ONLY* type of encryption chips available to
the masses?

Sure, you might have your own method of encryption, but if you don't
have anyone else to talk to, what use is it?  You can't assume that
EVERYONE will be as open as you appear to be about encryption.

The point here is not the specific instance of the Wiretap Chip.
Rather, it is like having the government telling you that they want a
copy of your house key, safe-deposit box keys, etc., and telling you
that "they wont use them unless its totally neccessary."  I sure
wouldn't want that.  Why should encryption be any different?

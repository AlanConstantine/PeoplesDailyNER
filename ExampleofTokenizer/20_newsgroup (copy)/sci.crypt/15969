   It's not Clipper, it's any encryption system.  I've seen a number of
   designs; they generally involve a multi-line cleartext bridge.

Depending on the encryption system, so long as everyone has the same
key, it can be done.  For example, I was using "vat", which is an
Internet Audio tool, for a conference call, and we were encrypting the
session.  (Unfortunately, one site was doing more work, and didn't
have the CPU for it, so it didn't sound all that good at a different
site)

So, you don't neccessarily have to have a clear-text bridge.  But if
you do, its totally internal to one of the sites involved in the
conversation....

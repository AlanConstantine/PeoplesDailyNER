Tom Clancy omitted these key steps to try to prevent groups of people from
building a nuclear bomb.  However, he asserts that you can find these key
steps in any university library.  The main point of _Five Minutes To Midnight_
is that it is impossible to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons,
since it has become easy to acquire the knowledge to build one, and fissible
materials are nearly impossible to control.  Read this article, or better
yet, run to your library yourself and dig up some stuff on constructing a
nuclear weapon.

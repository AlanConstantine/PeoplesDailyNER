Yes. Reasonable parallels. (though I don't think Russia ever claimed to be
Communist)

I must protest your "...in a Communist country". How do you know?
There haven't been any, and are unlikely to ever be any. In some Socialist
dictatorships, you can't, whilst in some socialist democracies
(such as France or Australia)
you can. Of course, some people may disagree about France & Australia being
socialist...

>it, (or rather, you're complaining about it) and nobody is shooting at us.  

Yet.

In some circumstances. I was at a public meeting last night (in the USA), where
a protester, who was very nice and calm, and just said before the
speaker started to beware of his opinions, was forced out of the meeting by
two armed policemen.

There are a lot of things that one cannot do in the USA. You may not
notice them, but as an Australian visitor, I notice them.

Yes, we are lucky at the moment. I hope that is still true in
a few years time. Because it didn't just happen...it required concious
effort.

Of course don't over react --- but don't under react.

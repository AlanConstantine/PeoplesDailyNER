Another objection occurred to me.  There was a comment about how
supposedly there would only be one decode box, operated by the FBI.
This is flat ridiculous, and I don't believe it for a millisecond.
Even *if* they in fact only build one (or two or some other small
number) of these, that won't stop others from building one.  Make
it work like two Clipper-chip phones, one listening to each side
of the recorded conversation.  I'll have to have another look at
the specs posted so far, but offhand I didn't see anything that
would preclude this sort of thing.....

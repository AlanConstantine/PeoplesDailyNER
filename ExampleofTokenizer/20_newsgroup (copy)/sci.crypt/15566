So what? Justices William Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, John Paul
Stevens, and Byron White are associated with a plurality Supreme Court
decision that prevented the removal of "anti-American, anti-Christian,
anti-Semitic, and just plain filthy" books from a public high school
library [_Board of Education v. Pico_ (1982)]. Does this mean that
they could no longer defend free expression and privacy?

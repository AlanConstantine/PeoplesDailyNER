I feel like Winston Churchill in 1941 :( ...... but,
the privacy Clipper will, TO THE EXTENT KEY ESCROW IS LEGITIMATE, stop
most of the abuse of wiretaps by local cops, company cops, angry husbands/
wives, etc...  It is going to be hard for the keystone cops, the
Proctor&Gamble cops, etc. to bypass even a product as flawed as the ClipJob.

Now I admit, I am hard pressed to find anything else good to say about it
except that, if it actually takes off, someone will certainly come up with
a REAL crypto chip (pin compatable!) that we can buy... Unless, of course,
Big Brother makes it illegal to have real crypto 'cause good honest law
abiding citizens will be HAPPY to let the government listen to their
every word.... "Me? Did I say THAT?"

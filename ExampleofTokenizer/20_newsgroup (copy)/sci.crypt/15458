Clipper might be a good way to cover the use of another layer of
encryption.

Currently, when you send an encrypted message, an opponent can usually
tell 1) that you are using encryption 2) which encryption method you
are using [because that information is usually in the clear].

With clipper, most opponents will only know that you are sending
clipper-text, they won't know that your clipper-text is itself
encoded.

Only those few opponents who get your clipper-keys will know
that your message is double encrypted.

... kind of like a safety deposit box containing a lock box.

So, don't just think of replacements for clipper, also think of front
ends.

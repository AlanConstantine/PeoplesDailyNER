IMHO, encryption is (also) protected under the SECOND amendment of
the Constitution of the United States.

I am not surprised that this administration is doing this.
I could have told you so.

Privacy has ALWAYS been something that has the effect of restricting
out ability to prosecute criminals.  We are supposed to have the
presumption of innocence.

I have the right to pull the curtains over my windows and close my
door, and the police may not come in.  If I perform a crim in my home,
they will have to find out by means other than simply looking.

Encryption is to my data as the window curtains are to my home.
Simple enough?

And yet the people vote for these people because they come out a lie
to them about promising to fix things.

You mean they might have to go back to actually WORKING to do their job?
Oh heavens.

Perhaps the FIRST amendment.  Definitely the SECOND and FIFTH.

Unfortunately, the vast segments of the population are misinformed.
They just haven't appended -SR to the name of out country, yet.

I seriously doubt that the NSA thinks that privacy and surveillance are
compatible.  I doubt of any smart person in any other agency thinks
so, either.  The PROBLEM is that they simply hold PRIVACY to be of no
value at all.

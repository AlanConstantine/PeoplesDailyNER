I recall seeing a post some time ago saying that if the details of
an encryption scheme couldn't be revealed, then the encryption
scheme is worthless.  I believe the statement was in response to
somebody saying that they had some new snazzy scheme, but the
algorithm was a secret.

Does this algorithm depend on the fact that the scheme is secret or
is it for the stated reasons above?

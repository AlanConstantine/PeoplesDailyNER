And the initiative for actual implementation.  Clinton is not just an
innocent bystander here - They didn't just slap his name on it without
consulting him.  What exactly is his extensive history of individual

with this?  He just went back on his pledge to cut the espionage
budget, and is now asking for more money than even Bush wanted.

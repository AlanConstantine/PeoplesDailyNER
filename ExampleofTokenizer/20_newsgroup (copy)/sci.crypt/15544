First, what the fuck is NASA doing wasting my tax dollars doing
policy papers on stuff far outside of their purvew/mission?
                                                                         
Second, this isn't a problem of economics.  This is a problem of
the incremental accumulation of police-state powers by our government.
 
How, exactly, do you put a price on the loss of freedom of a society?
Maybe use the dollars/life lost calculations for the extra people
killed by the gov.  The pain and suffering cases for those tortured.
The dollars/life lost caused by the inevitable collapse of the economy,
and all the secondary effects of diseases, diet, etc.  Plus, the
inevitable collapse of the economy as the gov controls it, becomes 
corrupt, etc.

Do us a favor.  Resign rather than right this paper for NASA.  Go
do useful work for the society.

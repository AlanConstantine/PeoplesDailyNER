Well, regardless of what policy liabilities anyone in Washington may think
EFF has, it is going ahead aggressively attacking the assumptions that are
behind the Administrations Clipper Chip initiative.  For all the reasons
stated here.  In Washington, you have to work under the assumption that 
everyone has some liabilities.  Government and non-governmental 
organizations alike all share the same glass house.  EFF is variously
identified as the Hacker Defense Fund, the First Amendment Absolutists,
the New Communists, etc, but it is also an acknowledged leader in the
civil liberties arena and is respected as a serious player in the 
policy circles.  So unless there is another organization with the
credibility and clout and right policy stance that you know of in
Washington, please don't count EFF out as a valid representative of
your views in the Clipper Chip matter.

	I am an idiot. The plaintext that's relevant is the session key.
If you know that, you probably don't need a roomful of chips, do you?
If you were going to brute force something interesting, that'd be the
message stream, which is sort of approximately known by, say, a bug in
my office. Then your roomful of chips could get the session key. Which
I change every morning.

	Really, it's just a whole lot easier for the illicit wiretappers
to stick a bug in your phone.

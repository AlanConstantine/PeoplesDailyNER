Other alternatives include output of vmstat, iostat, pstat and friends
with various flags, or even better crash. 

e.g. on an RS/6000 (AIX 3.2) you can get lots of relatively
unpredicatble data out of crash. (the output from the following script 
usually gives about 600k of goo on a moderately busy system.)

#!/bin/sh

tty

pcb

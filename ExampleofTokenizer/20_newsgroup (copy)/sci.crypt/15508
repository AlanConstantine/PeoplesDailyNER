Actually, many of us have noted this. We have noted that the program
started at least 4 years ago, that the contracts with VLSI Technology
and Microtoxin were let at least 14 months ago, that production of the

Nobody I know has claimed Clinton intitiated the program. But he chose
to go ahead with it.

I'm sure Dorothy Denning is an honest person and wouldn't lie to us.
Simply think up a question to ask her about her involvement, but be
very careful to phrase it in such a way that there can be no Jesuitical
evasion or a true but wholly misleading answer.

In this country, MI5 are *experts* at answering these questions; for
instance there was a British journalist (Jonathon Moyle) killed in South
America a couple of years ago.  Parliament asked "Was he an MI5 employee"
"No." - turns out afterwards he wasn't paid, therefore wasn't an employee.
They could equally have said he wasn't an agent - he went abroad on his
private business with no brief from MI5, but was interviewed and debriefed
at length only *on his return*.

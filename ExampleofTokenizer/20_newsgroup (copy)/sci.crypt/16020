         Is it realistic for the government to try to keep the details
of the encrytion algorithm secret if it intends to use evidence from
wiretaps in court?  Won't defense attorneys attempt to obtain the
details of the method if the prosecution attempts to present evidence
from wiretaps in court?  Is it certain that such attempts will fail?

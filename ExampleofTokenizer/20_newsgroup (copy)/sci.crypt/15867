CompuServe is in Columbus, OH.  So are the corporate headquarters of several 
major insurance companies, the largest private R&D company in the world 
(Batelle Memorial Institute), DCSC (The Defense Construction & Supply 
Center), Ohio State University (one of the three largest US universities), 
OCLC (the Online College Library Center), and so on.  You'd be amazed, 
actually.

Columbus only *looks* like a cow town.

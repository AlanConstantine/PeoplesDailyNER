I have a couple reasons why I would be more likely to trust this algorithm:
	1. The algorithm will be made totally public, once it is patented.
	2. The keys will NOT be escrowed.
Of course if either of these is not true, I will not use this new algorithm.
Since I have never seen this new algorithm, I have no idea how secure it is
yet.

I can't make any judgements about the algorithm itself yet, but I do notice
that the creators of this algorithm are being more open about how the
thing works, and is willing to make it public, showing that after a bit
of scrutiny, any weaknesses will probably be revealed, while we don't know
about Clipper.

  The only theory that makes any sense is that S1 and S2 are either the
same for all chips, or vary among very few possibilities, so that anyone
trying to break the encryption by brute force need only plow through the
possible serial numbers (2^30, about one billion), multiplied by the number
of different S1, S2 combinations.

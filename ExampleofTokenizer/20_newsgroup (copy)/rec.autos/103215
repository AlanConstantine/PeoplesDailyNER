I bought a set of ARE's a few months back and decided to add locks
so that I could keep my new rims. I haven't had a balance problem 
yet so I assume that it might be just particular to your type of
stock nuts. My rims were balanced with new BFG T/A's at a speed 
shop to the finest setting on their bal. machine, so that helps too.

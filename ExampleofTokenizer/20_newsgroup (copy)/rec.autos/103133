However, if you agree some terms, and then, when about to sign, the
dealer slips you a contract with different terms, and leads you to
believe that it embodies the terms you verbally agreed to, that
is fraud.  There is no 3 day limit on restitution for fraud.

You may have to sue (and win) to get out of this.  You will almost
certainly have to threaten to sue.

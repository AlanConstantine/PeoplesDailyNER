When do the new M.benz "C" class cars come out?
The new nomenclature that MB has adopted will it only apply to the "c"
class cars or will it also apply to the current "s" class cars.
Does any one know what will replace the current 300 class since the "c"
class will be smaller and more in line with the current 190. 
Another question, Is BMW realising a new body style on the current 7
series and 5 series. They seem to be a bit dated to me.

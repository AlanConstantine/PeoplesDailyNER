good point.  you would think by now that most car companies would just make
4 wheel disc standard and be done with it.  can it really cost that much more
for disc?  especially when you think of the economies of scale they would gain
by just making them all 4 wheel disc.  no seperate parts numbers and orders 
etc.  btw, the z28 and trans am and formula have 4wheel disc, but the bottom
line models have the rear drums.

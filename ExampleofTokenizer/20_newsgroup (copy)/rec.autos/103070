not sure about there in CA, but here in US, the manuals are quite often the
standard equipment.  Of course, FINDING a car with one might be hard, but
if you read the sticker on the window, there is usally an additional 2k or
so tacked on for that lousy  tranny.  So you actually ARE paying more, just
that it's sometimes hard to find one that is equipped "standard".  (this
applies to MOST cars, but not to the luxoyachts..eg caddilac, licolns, etc..)

No one should EVER rely on just a magazine to determine what car they
buy, I don't care what magazine. Btw, I subscribe to three other 
auto rags, I just think CU is getting a bum rap by these macho men
from hell who think real men should read . . . .

Statements like what you said above have no meaning. People keep on
saying "CU is only good for dishwashing detergent" or as you
said:"Relying on Consumer Reports . . . . is like. . ."  and that is
all they say. 

If there were as critical of themsevles as they are of CU maybe there
would be some real content.

GK>I hear that tires for this car can get really expensive.  I
GK>currently have Goodyear GT+4s that cost the previous owner $500
GK>for four.

Try Eagle GAs, wear better, cost less, lose little handling, and are
quieter.  I'm going to switch to 225s in my next set, with new rims
(Fitti Twists) if I can afford 'em by the time my GAs wear out.

GK>is a whole new ritual for me with that fangled pedal!  Also, I began
GK>to wonder how strong that brake really is.  (Today, I backed out of
GK>parking spot today and started to drive away before I noticed
GK>the glowing brake light.  Oops.)

Mine is strong enough to not let the car move when it's in, even if you're
giving it enough gas to normally move it in 1st.  You might need a brake
adjustment.

GK>The driver's power window creaks when closed all the way.  The same
GK>thing happens in my parents 1989 Mercury Sable.  Oddly, all the
GK>other windows work smoothly.

Watch it closely, the glass actually flexes from the torque in the motor, it
seems stronger in the drivers window then the others.

GK>I'm liking the interior amenities more and more each day.  The
GK>cupholders are great.

I've found the location (under the armrest in between the seats) to be a
pain, but like having them.  They moved it into the dash (pop out) in the
'91 model year, MUCH better.

GK>I really feel like I don't deserve this car.  I really can't
GK>believe that I could afford it.  I got this car ten years
GK>ahead of schedule.  :-)

I did the same thing.  Got a black '89 with 65.5k miles on it for $8k
in July '92.

GK>I've put together the responses to my questions about the cars, as
GK>well as other posts with useful information on these cars.  I'll be
GK>posting this in the form of a FAQ soon.

Grabbed it and archived it.  Thanks!

GK>If anyone is interested in starting a mailing list, please speak up!
GK>I don't know if I have the resources here at Purdue to start one, but
GK>maybe someone out there does.

I'll be starting one this summer, one way or the other (current software
I use dosen't support mailing lists, but is on the RSN list - if not, I'm
going to upgrade to another package that DOES have it), that is, if nobody
else beats me to it.  Will make an announcement here when it goes up.

Here we go...

No, of course Porsche doesn't have a patent on the "targa" name.  If that were
the case, what would Fiat do?  I suppose that technically my del Sol is not a
"convertible" in the literal sense, but it certainly classifies as an open-
topped car.  In addition, the rear section behind the removable top is what
makes my car _infinately_ safer than a convertible.

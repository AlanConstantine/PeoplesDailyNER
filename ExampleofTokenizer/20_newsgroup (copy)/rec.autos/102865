  I would suggest you take the car to the nearest Chevron dealer, with
your own oil and filter.  Ask for an oil change.  It will cost less
than $10.  Watch him/her do it.  Just from watching someone do a job,
you will be able to learn and remember the sequence, and do it right
when you do it yourself the next time.  Besides, when he/she loosens
the drain nut, the next time around it will be easier for you.

  If it is stuck, use an impact wrench.  Not too much force though.
Use a new washer each time you put the nut back.....

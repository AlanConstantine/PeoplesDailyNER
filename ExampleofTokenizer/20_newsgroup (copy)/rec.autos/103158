	"The Villager-Quest seem like the best of the Cravan/Voyager

I'll agree about villager but not MPV -- it's so small that I'd class
it as a SUV with an extra seat shoehorned in.  To get any rear cargo
space, you shove the back seat up against the middle seat, eliminating
*all* leg room.

Back to the Villager ...

	"Only the price is controversial."

And the use of attack belts instead of 3-point belts.  That killed it
for me.

If your Viper system were tuned like a neighbor's is you wouldn't get
any sleep because of the damn thing waking every one in the neighborhood
up.

We all used to try to ignore the alarm, but have now made a pact to
bombard the house with night-time visits and phone calls when ever we
are awakened because some thunder storm passed over the next county
or a stray dog looked at the car.

Car alarms are a serious pain-in-the-ass!

p.s. Real men don't have car radios since the exhaust is too loud to
     hear it anyway <GRIN>!

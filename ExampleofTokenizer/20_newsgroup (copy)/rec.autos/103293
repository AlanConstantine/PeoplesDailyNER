	Well, let's see, in just my own _personal_ experience there's
Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Wyoming, Utah, South Dakota, Nebraska, 
Minnesota, Montana, Florida, and parts of Louisianna.

	Nobody said "Let's go into town and drive 130 on Main St."
And you couldn't go that fast on the graveled washboard that passes
for highway in some parts.  But that "only really expensive cars should
be driven fast" crap, is, well, crap...

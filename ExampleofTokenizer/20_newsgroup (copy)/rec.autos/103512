If a manual transmission is a "must have", then the M-B 300TE is not in
the running.  You cannot get a manual transmission in that car in North
America.  It seems that buyers here (or, maybe more accurately, the
distributors) are not interested in manual trannies.

The '93 300 line comes with a 217 hp engine.  All earlier years are 177 hp.
I have an '87 300E, with a "mere" 177 hp and auto tranny, and I find that
it has sufficient power for any normal driving situation.  More is always
nice, but I can't complain.

I test drove a Saab 900 CSE last fall.  Here are my impressions:

1) Awesome power, especially over 3500rpm, when the turbo really comes on.
2) If you get on the power really hard in a tight corner, the front-wheel
   drive causes it to understeer heavily, and then viciously "hook" into
   the corner.  Not a desirable handling trait, but common in powerful
   front drive cars.  (The CSE is 200hp.  Mercedes is rear-drive, so it
   does not have this problem.)
3) Huge interior and cargo space.
4) The most "rubbery" shifter I have ever encountered.  I drove a 5spd.  It
   was absolutely numb.  You might be able to get used to it - I don't know.
   I also didn't like its location, which was too far down, and too far right.
   From the shifter's position, I got the impression that Saab really designed
   the car for an automatic.
5) It was rather noisy:  Engine buzz, rattles, and creaks.  (Mercedes does
   not exhibit these characteristics.)

You should also check out the new BMW 525 "touring".  This is a wagon version
of the 525i.  It fits into the class with the 300TE and Saabs.

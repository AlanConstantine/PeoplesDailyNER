A couple of months ago I went to a dealership to test drive a car.  Afterwards,
we sat down to discuss prices.  I explained that I wanted a car just like the
one I drove, but in a different color.  He said he could get one exactly like
I wanted from the dealer network within a day.  We then negotiated a price and
signed the deal.

Next day, I get a call.  He explains that they goofed, and they had neglected
to take into account a price increase. (The last price increase had occurred
over 4 months prior to my visit.)  If I still wanted the car, I would
have to fork over another $700.  As an alternative, they would honor the
price if I bought the car I test drove (which had been sitting around for 
6 months and had a few miles on it). I said goodbye.  This was a good
example of how they can lowball you and still cover their butts.  It's too
bad more people don't demand honesty or these types of dealers would
no longer be in business.  

The next dealership I went to was straightforward and honest.  First thing the
salesman said was, "Lets's see what you have for dealer cost and work out
how much profit I should make."  The deal went through with no problems.

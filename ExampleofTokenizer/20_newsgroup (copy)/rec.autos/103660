 A 68 Corvette but, I don't want to put Corvette seats in it.  The original
 seats are in exc. shape but they are uncomfortable as hell.  I'm going to
 store those and find a set to drive in.  I have all the Vette catalogs but
 I'm looking for a more generic type seat.  I can modify the brackets but 
 cushion height and overall width are a concern.  I've looked through some
 local boneyards without success.  I would just like to find a pair of 
 cheapo's to use this summer.

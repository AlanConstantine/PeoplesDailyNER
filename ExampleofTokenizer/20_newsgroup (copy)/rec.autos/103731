Not only the Sonett (correct spelling), but the 95 wagon and 96 sedan
used a 1500 cc or 1700 cc V-4 from Ford of Germany.  This particular
motor had a 60 degree vee angle, a balance shaft and siamesed exhaust
ports.  This motor was later stretched into the V-6 commonly seen in the
Capri.

The V-4 could make pretty reasonable power for its size.  But in the
Saab, it made too much torque for the transmission, which had been
designed for a 3-cylinder 2-stroke.

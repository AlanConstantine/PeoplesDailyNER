Shaz,

Hmm.. but the service indicators that I have works this way:
  There are 5 green,1 yellow, 1 red indicators.
  initially all green indicators will be on for few minutes when you start
  your car. The computer will actually "sense" how you drive your car and
  as time goes by the green indicators will start to go off one by one and
  then the yellow indicator will turn on and then the red indicator will go
  on. And you should get service when by the time green indicators are off.
  
  After service the mechanic(or you) will reset the service indicators and the
  computer starts counting again.

So I expect to have a tool(or a procedure) to reset it so the green lights will 
come on and the yellow and red lights will go off.

I wonder how people can do oil change themself without knowing how to reset the
indicator.

It's the first european car I have and changing oil at 15,000 miles is a 
surprise to me. and it's a big plus :-). But I wonder how that could happen
since the oil lose its lubrication ability over time, I thought it's the oil and
not the vehicle that determines how often we should change oil.

Any BMW owner on the net? Response welcomed.

PS.  my initial question is "how do you seset the service indicator of a BMW"

V4s? I don't know of any. I4s and flat4s are abundant.

>V6 - Legend, MR3? MR6?

A whole $h!tload. Minivans, pickups, just about any car above the
subcompact/compact range and below the full-size range (with a few
exceptions).

I6s are much more rare now; the only one I personally know of that's
still in production is the venerable Ford 300CID in the F-series pickups.
I think that Jeep's big 6's are also straight sixes, but I'm not a
big Jeep person.

>V8 - Don't know of any.

Where are you to not know of V8s? There are Mustangs, Cadillacs,
Lincolns, Camaros, Corvettes, Thunderbirds, all real full-size
pickups, Crown Vics, Chevy Moby^H^H^H^HCaprice ;-), and even a few
Japanese and European vee-hickles with V8s.

V10 - Dodge Viper; Dodge promises a truck with a V10.

>V12 - Jaguar XJS

Don't Ferarri and Lamborghini both use V-12s extensively?

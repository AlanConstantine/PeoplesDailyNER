i'm sorry, as i have never heard of any of this.  Guess they don't think
it's important enough for a classroom, and i was going on what i've seen
in pics.(some movies--real nice scource there, huh?)  I just always 
recall thinking that GOOD roads of asphalt didn't come around til the
Interstate Hiway Act, or whatever they called it(60's?), and that wood and
cobblestone roads were fairly rare up through the depression, except in
overpopulated places like England and US cities.  Obviously netwisdom
says i am wrong.

i knew it was almost always done, but i knew of no reason that it might not
be done the other way by DeSoto for their car.  Seems like they had some
other deviations from the norm too, at times :-)

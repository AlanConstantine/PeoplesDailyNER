I don't know if some lemons are out there, but from personal experience
My brother's has been trouble free.  Not one single repair, only 
regular maintainance.  The only work he had done on it was a result
of his stupidity... he stopped suddenly in the middle of a left turn 
on a busy intersection, and was rear-ended.  He has a 1989 Plymouth
Sundance.  I would recomend it, but I would also like to say that if
you can wait about six months, ChryCo is coming out with a new car
called the Neon, that is built in the same way as the LH's where.
Good luck with your desiscion.

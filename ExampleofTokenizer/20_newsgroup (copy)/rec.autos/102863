If your buying a compact pickup do yourself a favor and wait a few months
for the 1994 GMC sonoma.  Magazines are saying it is day and night over the
current truck.  It's georgeous, solid, and fast (200hp Vortec 4.3 V-6).
Should whip the Ranger in every area too (accept maybe payload).  And always
pick a GMC over a Chevy.  GMC's are always so much better looking.  Man, I 
miss the Comanche.

Hi, I was looking for some helpful advice.
I'm a university student with about $7000 to spend, and I'm looking for a 
used car. Does anyone have any useful advice they could offer to a first-
time buyer? I'm not looking for anything sporty, just something functional 
and reliable (less maintenance costs). Anybody have any ideas on what models 
might suit me?

Thanks

Sanjai

An aquaintence has a 87 Accord.  The driver's side headrest was
accidentally put in backwards and has jammed.  According to the
dealer, the only way to get it out is to spend several hours
disassembling the seat.  This is the second time I have heard of this
happening, and I wonder whether there's an easier way to get the
headrest back out.  Has anyone else ever dealt with this problem?
Your advice would be appreciated!

Please email, and I will summarize if there is interest.

I know this is the wrong place to post this, but I couldn't find any
relevant newsgroups in my area.

For those of you who are from PA, where is VASCAR (where the cops
measure your speed from the time it takes you to cross the distance
between two white lines on the road, right?) most commonly used?  I'm
especially interested in the Pittsburgh area (specific locations, prior
experiences, if possible).  For those PA and non-PA, if they use VASCAR
in your state, is it most common in rural, city, highway areas, etc. 
What I'm interested in mainly is where I can speed with the least risk
of being caught.  You can always detect radar, but there's no way to
fight VASCAR unless you know where all the white lines are.

Thanks a lot,

    Arun Jayakumar

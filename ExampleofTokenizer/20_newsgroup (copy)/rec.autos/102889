I dont know about the car comparison but as far as the price goes rest
assured that the street prices for the MX-3 and Escort and (maybe) even
the Honda will be lesser than that of the Saturn you're talking about.
All price comparisons I've seen are based on MSRP and of course the
saturn dealer will sell the car for sticker price whereas the others
will do it way below sticker.

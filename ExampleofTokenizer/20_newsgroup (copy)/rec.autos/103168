I couldnt agree more.  That is how it SHOULD work. People should also ALWAYS see motorcycles too.

I CONSTANTLY scan behind me (I have one of those wink mirrors) and two outside mirrors.  I actually spend just as much time checking my six (cops you know).

I still get caught off guard every now and then. 


Maybe I didnt word it right the first time.  What I was trying to say was that if you plan to blow by somebody at a very HIGH speed differential and you assume you are safe because the guy sees you, you are stupid (of course, it depends on the circumstances).  I have had some VERY scary instances when I assumed this and I dont think all of the fault was the other guy (now if he was going 25 in a 55 thats a whole different story)

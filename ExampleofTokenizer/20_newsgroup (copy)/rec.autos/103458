I have been having problems with a slightly different clutch problem on
my 90 Prelude. See rec.autos.tech for more detail. My problem is a false
engagement point below the actual one. It also seems affected by weather -
it is most noticeable (and annoying) on damp or cold days. My dealer says
he can't reproduce the problem - I think I'll just sell the car.

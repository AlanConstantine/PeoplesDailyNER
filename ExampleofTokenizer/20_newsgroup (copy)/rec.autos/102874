No. reverse lights are to warn others that you are backing up. They
aren't bright enough to (typically) see by without the brake and tail
lights.

Well, red and orange were already taken. Maybe white defines the direction
that the car is moving in.


If you really want to be able to see behind you, get some fog lamps for
the back of the car. These work very well - and are a good way to get
rid of tailgaters if you get that rush of testosterone.

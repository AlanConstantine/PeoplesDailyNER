i have no experience with State Farm, but i think it's important to
differentiate your experience from a typical "accident."

hail damage is clearly not the fault of the owner, and also tends to
be well publicized in the media, so it's to the ins. co.'s benefit
to respond promptly and helpfully.  damage like this doesn't imply
anything about the likelihood of future claims (unless you live in an
area that gets frequent damaging hail storms), so there's no reason
for them to stop covering you.
that's a lot different from at-fault accidents or theft-related claims,
which may be more indicative of claim patterns.

I am looking for recommendations for a good (great?) Alfa Romeo
mechanic in South Jersey or Philadelphia or nearby.

I have a '78 Alfa Spider that needs some engine, tranny, steering work
done.  The body is in quite good shape.  The car is awful in cold
weather, won't start if below freezing (I know, I know, why drive a
Spider if there's snow on the ground ...).  It has Bosch *mechanical*
fuel injection that I am sure needs adjustment.

Any opinions are welcome on what to look for or who to call.

Email or post (to rec.autos), I will summarize if people want.

Thx, Andy (brandt@cs.unc.edu)

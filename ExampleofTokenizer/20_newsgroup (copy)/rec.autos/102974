Hear, hear!  Thanks, Robbie.

You also don't read that much about violence *against* teenagers, such as
George Bush burying alive tens of thousands of unarmed Iraqi 17-year-olds,
who were trying to surrender, with bulldozers.


On the other hand, I think it *is* true, without singling out teenagers
for blame, that violence is more socially acceptable than it used to be.
Those of us who'd like to discourage violence have plenty of work to do
with people of all ages.

I've found mine ('93 Probe GT) to do quite well.

I've not had any of the air or leakage problems that have been reported but
do get the squeal that Bill describes.  I live in Seattle so the wet weather
may be a factor.

If I recall correctly I got two keys.

This is true.  I'm wondering if this may be a safety concern.  IE, if people
pound on the place where the airbag lives...

No opinion.

The 5 speed is much more fun.  We opted for the automatic for a number of
reasons but it's still fun, and in some ways more practical.

Ditto.

I too would suspect that this may be true.

Yes!

Ditto.

Agree. Check it out.  I don't mind it but would say that if it was much 
stiffer it might be a problem.  (How about the '93 R1 RX-7 for suspension?!)

True.

I've had this problem and read about it.  (or at least I assume the one
I had was the one I read about :-).  In any case what happened was the
weld between the muffler and the pipe feeding it (ok, so I'm not a mechanic)
broke.  In my case the dealer welded it, ordered replacement parts and
put them on when they got them.  I suspect this is some sort of 1) design
flaw, or 2) production flaw.  In any case I have an earlier model and would
expect it to be worked out on newer ones.  In any case it is a warrantee
repair.  (or they get the keys back!)

I second this.  There seems to be some things that slipped through but the
car seems very sound.  While not perfection (what is) you get an awful
lot for your money.

BTW, Bill has a Probe mailing list.  You might want to subscribe to it if 
you are interested in more detail.  Try request-ford-probe@world.std.com
(did I get that right?  never can remember if the request goes on the
front or the back :-)

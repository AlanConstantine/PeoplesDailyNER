Anyone have any opinions on fairly recent model Alfa Spiders ( 86-> ) 

Reliablilty for what their class ( I'm not talking Alfa vs. Toyota corrola
which is more relaible ) 

As far as I can discern, in recent years, there are 3 levels with all
basically the same mechanical aspects.

Please email any responses

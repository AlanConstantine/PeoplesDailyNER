This is a two-sided problem. Unfortunately our culture has been deteriorating over time.
The "breeding" of these low-life's is getting worse; our justice system is at best
extremely weak to handle these problems. That is why low-abiding citizens should have
the power to protect themselves and their property using deadly force if necessary 
anywhere a threat is imminent.

My Camaro (my pride and joy) got stolen right out of my driveway a few years back.
The persons that did that were eventually caught (lucky for me!) but not before
having trashed the car.

On another occasion, on my way from Texas to Florida, I had stopped in a small motel
for the night in a small town somewhere in Florida. About 5 youths were disturbing my
car, setting off the alarm and challenging me to come out. When I and another tenant
walked out with a 357 Magnum and a 45 automatic respectively, they vanished. 
Needless to say, I immediately packed-up and left.

Watch out for car-jacking and staged accidents. They can be deadly!

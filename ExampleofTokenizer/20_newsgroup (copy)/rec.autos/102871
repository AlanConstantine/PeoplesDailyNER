For those that are interested I got my fully optioned (Air, ABS,
sunroof) '92 SE-R in September 1991 for $13,555 in Sacramento, CA. It
was one of the 1st '92s sold, few of the dealers had any, no local
dealer had an ABS equipped SE-R.  I went straight to the fleet manager
at the dealership I liked, told him what I wanted, made him aware that I
knew what his price should be.  He called me back with exactly what I
wanted from a dealer 125mi away, I took delivery the next day.

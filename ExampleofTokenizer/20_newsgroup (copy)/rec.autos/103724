I have a 90 Eagle Talon and I wanted a pair of GTS 
Headlight covers.  Actually, they are turning signal
covers since the Talons that year had pop-up lights.
I went to a auto shop and bought the tail-light 
blackouts for $45, but they did not have the turning
signal covers in stock.  I asked how much it would be
and he told me it would cost me another $40.  I thought
this was a bit high for two small pieces of plastic.
Can anyone find me a cheaper pair or even a used one?

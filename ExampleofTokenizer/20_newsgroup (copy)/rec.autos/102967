In Des Moines, Iowa, about a year ago, some kid dropped a rock from an 
overpass and hit car just behind the windshield.  It put a dent in the roof, 
so I guess I was lucky it hit metal.

It's frustrating that we can't do much.  Bother the city government to put
covers on all overpasses?  Slow down/speed up a bit when driving under all
overpasses in the city?  I like the first better, but that will take time
and lots of people talking to the city governments.

Just another .02...

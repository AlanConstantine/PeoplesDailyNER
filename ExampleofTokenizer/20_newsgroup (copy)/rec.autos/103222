"traction control" as far as the optional feature that one buys with
cars is not the same thing at all as a torque sensing differential.

a torque sensing differential is a type of LSD, but not all LSD's
are torque sensing.  viscous coupled differentials (as opposed to
viscous couplings) are rotational sensing, not torque sensing.
for that matter, so are "traction control" systems that use ABS
sensors and pulse braking.

then there are the older posi-tracs and whatever which i am not
familiar with the workings.

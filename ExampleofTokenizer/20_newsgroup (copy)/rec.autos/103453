Just a quick note on the nwe shape MR2s in the UK.... 

When they first came out here, there were 3 models. The base model had an 
auto box and engine from the CAMRY 2.0 !!! Well I recentyl found out that this 
model is no longer profitable for Toyota and have since scraped it. I've also
noticed that auto MR2s have depreciated a lot more than the next model up...

Surprise surprise huh? Oh.... you lucky Americans have the turbo MR2 :-(
No such luck over here :-(

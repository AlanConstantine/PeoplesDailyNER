The VW "Thing" Kubelwagen lookalike is still manufactured in Mexico and 
possibly South America.  Good luck importing one--  They probably don't meet 
US safety and pollution requirements.  There are mechanics and junkyards 
which specialize in VW; they might be helpful for finding a "Thing" unless 
the WWII re-enacters have grabbed them all.

The WWII Kubelwagen was the German equivalent of the Jeep, but was not 4-
wheel drive.  One is on display at the Patton Museum at Fort Knox, Kentucky, 
also the rare "Schwimwagen" (sp?) amphibious version, in full-scale dioramas.
Highly recommended!

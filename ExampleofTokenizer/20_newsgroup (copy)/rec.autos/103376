Well, an LT1 Blazer wouldn't come close to a GMC Typhoon in speed, I think its
too heavy.  As it is right now, the normal 210HP 5.7 engine has plenty of 
power for a full size Blazer.  Of course, I'm not saying GM shouldn't put the
LT1 in it :).  It seems like they have a real winner with that engine.  Why
spend so much more money into getting a 32 valve DOHC V8 when you can take 
an LT1?  It even seems to get pretty good gas MPG (for a 5.7, that is.)

Yeah, it's a flat black, lowered 4 door Caprice riding on 17" aluminum rims and
Eagle GS-C tires.  The rest of the car is basically a Caprice LTZ (read: 
plush police package) with 300 horsepower.

I heard that Chevy is resurrecting the Monte Carlo but that's going to get 
their 3.4 DOHC V6 and not the LT1.

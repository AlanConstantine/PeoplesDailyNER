I am currently in the car market and would like opinions on a VW
Passat GLX.  How does it compare to a Toyota Camry?  I thought the car
looked very solid, stable and European.  Only disappointment so far is
that that it doesn't offer an airbao my next question is, why isn't VW
offering automobiles with airbags?  Should I pay the extra three
thousand for a BMW 318 is even though it is smaller and less powerful
than than the Passat?

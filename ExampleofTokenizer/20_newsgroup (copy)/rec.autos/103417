I agree that the Toyota is the best looking I just didn't fit plus it is the
highest cost of all the ones you mentioned. I have good friends who have all
three of the trucks you talked about, the ones with kids all went to the
ford because of the room required to carry a couple of kids and all the junk
you need. The single ones went for the Toyota and the Nissan. Every one has
been happy with what they bought. Although no one is into serious four wheel
off road driving.

        Check out the shocks where they mount, at both ends. if you have
    the type that have a loop?,from lack of a better term, and a bolt like
   piece sticking through, there should be a rubber bushing between the loop
   and the bolt. Is it there ? is it crushed and allowing metal to metal
    contact?  I hope you can make some sense of this. Good Luck.>

I'm having an interesting problem with my girlfriend's car.  Before
I delve into its innards, I thought I'd check "net.wisdom" on the
subject. :)

It's a 1985 Buick Skyhawk (I know...I know)
2.0l EFI 4-banger
auto
35k miles

When I drive tha car long enough to get it hot (especially at
highways speeds) the transmission has this nasty habit of
getting "stuck" in 3rd gear.  As a result, when you stop for
a light the motor stalls.  Putting the car in park, and waiting
for 30-60 seconds before restarting sometimes allows the transmission
to "reset" and go back into 1st.  Otherwise, it just stalls when
put in drive.  

My thoughts:  Either it the 3rd gear band is binding and getting
stuck when it gets hot (not so likely) or perhaps the lock-up
converter is not disengaging properly (seems likely).  The least
likely (keeping fingers crossed) is that some critical vacuum
hose has broken/cracked and this behaviour is due to lack of
vaccuum somewhere (as used to happen with old modulator valves).

My background is that my father owns a service station and
I worked there on and off from 10-19 years of age.  Please
feel free to be as technical as you want. :)

I'd appreciate hearing any tips/suggestions/offers of free
beer. <grin>

Skoal,

Chris

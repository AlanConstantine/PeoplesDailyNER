	Checker Motors went out of business in 1982.  It's hard to get
old Checkers that are worth restoring, since almost every one was
a fleet vehicle that was driven into the ground.  If you can get a 
body in decent shape the mechanicals should all be available _somewhere_ - 
Checker used whatever parts were around.  For instance, I had a Chevy
straight six and a GMC Truck radiator and a Ford rear in mine.

	Actually, you want a Checker Special if you can find one.

	Good luck.  I'm sorry I let mine go...

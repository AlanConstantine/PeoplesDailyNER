RADAR (Radio Association Defending Airwave Rights) says that Geico
insurance not only buy's Radar for police but also actively lobbies
states to promote making Radar Detectors illegal.   I think the
buying part is a misuse of money but the Radar Detector part shows
how little they know about the issue.  No study I am aware of has ever
concluded that detectors have a negative impact on safety or that
users have a higher average speed.  Incompetence by Geico?  I think
so.

re: extended Ka bands.

I recently bought a 2 band detector.  You guys must all think I'm
nuts, right?  Well, I did a little research into Ka usage in this
area and found out that Ka is not currently being used in this state
as well as surrounding states.  Here's how I found out:

- A cop friend who did spend time nailing speeders doesn't even know 
  what Ka is.  He's heard of K, which is what they use here and I
  explained that Ka is used for photo radar etc.. He then said, yeah,
  "Ka stands for K automatic"... duuhh.  He then went on to say that
  plans were being made for getting laser guns as far as going high
  tech were concerned, but he didn't know too much.

- My 8 year old 2 band whistler was consistently going off at speed traps,
  even the real sneaky ones.

- When I called the Escort Shop, they confirmed that Ka is not used here
  or in surrounding states.  They did claim that Laser was being used
  a lot here, which I was quite skeptical of.

So in the end, instead of spending a lot of money and/or waiting
months for a state of the art detector, I got a low priced, high
performance 2 band Escort 2200.  Incidentally its performance is equal
to their top of the line model in X and K band detection.  I know that
Escort has been surpassed by other brands lately, but I've never fully
relied on a detector and I was convinced that the Escorts would be at
least quite good, which was good enough for me and my wallet.

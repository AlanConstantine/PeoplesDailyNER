R. Goldstein (rdg@world.std.com) sez:
: As the subject says, I am moving from Mass. to Calif. and will be driving
: mostly on Interstate 80.
: Any advice from folks who have done it before?

- Plan your gas stops in major-city areas to avoid the 25 cent-per-gallon
"only gas station for 50 miles and you're an out-of-towner" surcharge.

- Prepare your car.  Don't forget things like your fuel & air filters.  If
you're loading your car up, consider putting your spare on TOP of your stuff
just in case of a flat.  In my x-country trip, a tire disintegrated in the
California desert & it took me 20 minutes to unload all my stuff to get to
the tire.

- If you have a hatchback, cover all your stuff with a white bedsheet to help
keep the stuff and your car cool, as well as *possibly* avoiding theft.

- McDonalds have good, clean bathrooms.

- invest in a $30 CB & magnetic roof antenna.  It may help if you're stranded,
and you can always ask people for places to stop for food, etc.

- Many times police like to hang out in the 1st 10 miles after you enter a
new state, to catch all the speeders who have "escaped" the previous state.

- Same as above; when you enter a 55mph city zone after hours and hours of
65mph rural interstate

I looked at that Bimmer yesterday. It's an '81, has about 90kmi, according
to owner (odometer stopped working at 68Kmi). Drivess well, sounds good,
body is OK, he wants $3000.
i liked the car, despite it's auto tranny, but my wife will be a primary
driver on this one, and she wants auto.
The radio does not work untill the car warms up and you honk the horn (!)
The A/C seems to have a leak. 
The sunroof is sticky, but operational.
Odometer does not work, as mentioned before.
Idle is a bit bouncy, going from 900rpm to 1200rpm.
Wipers are slow.
That's teh gripes. The owner says that he changed radiator, alternator, 
rotors and calipers, exhaust.
The biggest problem, is that the owner is a shifty SOB, telling strange
stories. I hate that. I would never buy from a persom like that, except, how
often you see a descent 528i for that amount of money. He also said that,
although I could bring a mechanicin, he wouldn't let me check the car by taking 
it to a garage. Suspicious. And who knows what milage is on it.
So, let me know what to check for, given there's practically no rust.
I know there was an article on 528i in R&D a few years back, anybody remembers
what issue?

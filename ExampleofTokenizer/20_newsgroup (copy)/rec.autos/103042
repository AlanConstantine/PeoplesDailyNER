Hello Netters,

I would like to find out information about a device that is used on vans and
trucks. This device is a step that hooks onto the tire and folds up for
storage. I've seen this device on TNN's Shady Tree Mechanic. I would like to
know if it is a good product and I would also like the price and address
of where I can purchase this product.

Thanks,

George Chan

     I used to drive a truck a few years back. I once rode with an old codger
that had been driving for about 30 yrs. The only time he would use the clutch
was to get the truck moving. He could shift that 13 speed lightning quick, up
or down, without the slightest rake of a gear. He was as smooth as silk. It was
the most amazing shifting demonstration I've ever seen! Having said all that I 
still don't know why anyone would want to shift a synchronized tranny without a
clutch? Why do it?

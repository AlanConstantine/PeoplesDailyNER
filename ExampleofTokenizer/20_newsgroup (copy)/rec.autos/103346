Having recently purchased a 93 Probe with clear-coat paint, I 
would like to give it a good wax job.  What is the Best type of
wax to use for this type of finish?  Is paste or liquid better?
I would be waxing it by hand, and buffing it by hand, I guess
using cheesecloth to buff it (anything better you would suggest?).

I've heard comments here before about things like Turtle Wax
and Raindance not being very good, so I'm wondering what is
recommended for a quality finish.

Thanks in advance.
Bill

I don't know about where you are, but here in California false
representation
of odometer readings is a criminal felony. If you can substantiate this,
you need to report that dealer to the local authorities. You should consult
with a lawyer to tell you what civil action you can take as well. Keep in
mind that you will have to prove that the dealer was aware of the change in
the dashboard.

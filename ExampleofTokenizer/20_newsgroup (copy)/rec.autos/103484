	I think the Blue Book is the NADA handbook for used car prices, no?
	Is the Blue Book value given the retail or wholesale value???  The 
	Blue Book value isn't set in stone, though.  Low milage, extra addons
	and stuff like that there can increase the resale price of the car, you
	may want to head on over to the local library or borrow your friends
	Blue Book and read up on that sort of stuff.  I paid ~$400 under BB
	(retail) for my '87 Civic in 1990, and it was in perfect condition and
	had only ~14.5K miles on it.  The guy was desparate to sell, new kid on
	the way, etc., but it was a good price.  Remeber, both you and the 
	buyer, if he has any sort of brains at all, are using the Blue Book, so
	you should pick a fair price.

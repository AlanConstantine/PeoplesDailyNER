  I am in the market to buy a used car. I am particularly
interested in the Pontiac Bonneville. My budget is between 7-
8 thousand. Would I be able to afford an 88 or 89. What
engines were available at this time. I know they didn't
redesign until the 1992 model year. How is the reliability of
past models. I would appreciate any advice or information.

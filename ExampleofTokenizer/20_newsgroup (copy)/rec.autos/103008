As I recall from reading posts here a while back, Rovax (Rovacs?) died
because it was larger and noisier than the competing cheap R12 systems
of it day.  Probably a case of bad timing.  I think the system would
have a better chance today now that R12 systems are on death row, but
investors may be hard to come by a second time.

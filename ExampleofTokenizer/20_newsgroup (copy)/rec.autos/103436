The DeLorean had the yucky PRV V6 engine. A joint-venture between Peugout (note 
spelling), Renault and Volvo. PRV. This engine is a *MIGHTY BORING* piece of
junk with approx 140hp. Doesn't like revs at all.

If you look at the DeLorean in the movie Back To the Future you will note
that they changed the engine sound to a big V8. A real DeLorean doesn't sounds
half as good. You will also note that every time they have to spin the tires
in the movie the ground is all wet. This is because a DeLorean can't make
a burnout on a dry road! The weak engine thats mounted over the rear axle
makes it almost impossible.

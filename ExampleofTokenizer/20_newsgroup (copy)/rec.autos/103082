foot in mouth again, drew.  the first generation mr 2's were 1.6's which 
were very smooth.  i'd be real surprised if the original poster was talking
about a 1st generation car.  the second generation cars were 2.2 for the
non turbo and 2.0 for the turbo.  i drove the non turbo 2.2 and calling it
unpleasant is to be kind to it..

wrong and wrong.  mitsubishi owns the patent, which has since expired
which is why everybody with a shred of integrity is putting balance
shafts into their big 4's.. the notable exception is nissan.. and only
for the us market suckers.  i guess we need to write to C&D and start
telling them to publish graphs for engine vibration over rpm.  then
you'll see usenet discussions of the form: engine A has peak
vibrations 3 dB less than engine B, therefore engine A is better than
engine B.

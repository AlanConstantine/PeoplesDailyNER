Anybody got any good/bad experience with selling their car through one of
those car hunters?  I'm selling a 1991 Dodge Stealth R/T and I was contacted
by this company called the Markham group based out of Illinois.  

They said they have 7-10 buyers in my area interested in my car or they wouldn't
be talking to me.  They talked to me for a good 20 minutes asking everything
about my car and said they could sell it no problem.  They guaranteed that if
they didn't sell my car in 75 days, I would get my money back ($389) and since
I charged it, I'm protected by federal law which states that if I'm not satisfied,
I would get a refund (which is true).  They federal expressed all the paperwork 
to me which had a contract stating their policy about the 75 days and such.

I called up the BBB in Illinois and they do not have a file on them which is
good news.  So they definitely are a legitimate company but so far, it's been
over week and I have gotten nothing.  So how effective are these types of 
companies? Anybody care to share their experiences?

In response to a post about SUV's, I got several unsolicited recommendations to
check out the Land Cruiser, despite its astronomical price.
The Toyota dealer told me it's a "cult car".
If a car is good enough to create a passionate and loyal following, there
must be something really extraordinary about it.
So, all you Land Crusher Cultists - here is your chance to convert me.

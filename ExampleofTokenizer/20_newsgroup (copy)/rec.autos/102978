No, that sounds pretty reasonable for that car and that city.

>Probability that I'll be needing more insurance?
Unless you have an accident, you won't need more.  If you plan on
paying for the car with a credit card, check and see if your card
automatically covers rental cars.  Also, your own auto insurance may
cover rental cars also.

Most rental companies here offer extra insurance when you rent, and
require you to initial in several spots if you don't want it.  The
credit cards and personal auto insurance provide the same sort of
coverage that the rental agency is trying to sell.

I have never rented from Alamo, so I don't know if they follow this
same practice.

>Is the beretta a good rental car?
Yes.  It is a compact 2-door, probably a bit dull performance and
acceleration-wise, but very adequate.  It will have an automatic
transmission, AM/FM stereo, air conditioning, and possibly power 
windows and door locks.

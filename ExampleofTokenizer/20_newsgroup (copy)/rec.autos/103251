  greetings:
  you may be in luck.  i seem to recall seeing a blurb in one of
the kit car magazines about a company in norway who pulled a
mould (sp?) off a real kubel, and has adapted it to the beetle
floorpan.  as for the suspension, all i can remember about the
vw thing i used to own is that it had about 3" more suspension
travel than a stock beetle, but i'd heard that there were after-
market parts for off-road use that were as good or better.  note
that the major difference (looks wise) between a kubel & a thing
are the hood and the fenders.  the kubel had an external spare
mounted *on* the hood, and the hood sloped down (for visibility?)
sharply, and had rounded fenders.  the thing has a lightly sloped 
hood with the spare mounted inside (unless moved to make for more
luggage space...) and has half-hexagon shaped fenders (imagine a
nut large enough to put a tire *in*, and cut off the bottom half
of it...).
  unfortunately, i don't have that info anymore.  try stopping
at a local bookstore and copying down the phone numbers for the
two big mag's and calling them.  they might be able to get the
number for you (don't forget to calculate the time difference to
norway before calling...).

later,
kc

I can't tell if Matt is being sarcastic here or not, but to be honest, many
automobiles are worth far more to their owners (in $$ value and $$ investment)
than the people that would take them.  I don't have figures on average property
tax in the U.S. or how much of it is allocated for housing projects, inferior
public schools, jails, or the like, but I have a feeling that the amount the
government steals from an honest, productive citizen to breed this trash is 
significantly less than the value of many automobiles.  And for those who will
argue that the animals out there stealing cars and everything else (not to
mention committing COMPLETELY senseless acts of violence, such as rape) cannot
be valued in terms of money because they are human beings, I submit that they
are not human beings.  Jim Callison, I think, is on the right track.  And 
Chintan Amin remarked earlier that we cannot blame environment for the actions
of a single criminal.  I couldn't agree more.  One could trace any crime back
to the environment/upbringing of the criminal; should we let all of them out,
from pickpockets to rapists to inside traders, because what they did wasn't
their fault?  Where does one draw the line?

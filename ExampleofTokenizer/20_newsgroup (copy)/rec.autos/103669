Hello again, another question.  :)

I just got my hands on 2 quarts of ReadLine Gear Oil (at $7 a quart)
now I need to know how to throw it into my car.

I own an 89 NIssan Maxima Se, any Ideas?
Can I mix the Oil in there with this stuff, or should I drain first, then
	only use this stuff.
If you know where (if there is one) the drain plug on the manual transmission
	on the Maxima is, I would really appreciate any comments.
Also have any of you Maxima owners, thied this stuff in your cars?

Thanks in ADV.
Sammy

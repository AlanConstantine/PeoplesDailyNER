Sure, but the surface condition of most good autobahns is far better
than most of the roads here. A dip in the asphalt that you test your
shocks on at 60 will kill you at 130. Don't get me wrong, I love to
drive quickly and they say my Probe will do 130, but that's 30 more
than I've ever tried in it cause there isn't a decent enough piece
of road hereabouts.

Consumer Reports once wrote about the S-10 Blazer that it "shook and rattled
like a tired taxi cab".  There is one noise that is expecially irritating -
the back window squeaks.  I believe its because the whole tailgate assembly
and window are not solid.  Anyway, has anyone had the same problem, and have
you found any fixes?

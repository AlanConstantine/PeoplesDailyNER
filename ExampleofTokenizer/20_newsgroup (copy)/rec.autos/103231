Junk?  They've made the C&D lists for years due to their excellent handling and  
acceleration.  They have been around since about, oh, 85 or 86, so they're not  
the newest on the lot, and mileage is about five to eight MPG under the class  
leader.  You can get into a 3.0 L v-6 (141 hp) Shadow for $10~11K (the I-4  
turbo a bit more), and a droptop for $14~15K.

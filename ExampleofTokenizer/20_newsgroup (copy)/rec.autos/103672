Primarily milage.  Gas is much more expensive, so people are very
concerned about it taking a few more liters per kilometer.  This,
along with narrow old cities, also results in smaller cars with
smaller engines.  These engines usually don't have the torque to mesh
well with an automatic.  So, having engines that don't work well with
autos, and a great concern for milage, the usual Euro-car has a
manual.

(Note that not many big Benzes come with manuals.  If you've got the
money for the car, you've got the money for the gas, and the engine to
drive through the slushbox.)

As automatics become more efficient, the "bigotry" is probably
reduced.  Still, everyone knows how to drive a manual, and cars are
cheaper with one, and it saves a little expensive fuel.  So there
aren't compelling reasons to go automatic.

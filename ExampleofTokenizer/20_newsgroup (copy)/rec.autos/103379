While previous Volvos have been essentially very fast tractors, the 3,4 and 8 series
are far from 'agricultural' in design or execution (how many FWD tractors have you 
seen?).

>2.Have godlier than thou advertising. 

You state this like it is a bad thing.  :^)  (remember, car companies use
ad agencies - they don't do their own ads!)

>3.are part of Renault.

Is this true?  I know that they had done joint ventures with Renault, but I haven't
heard about their subsumption into Renault - does this mean that the French Government
now owns Volvo?  - anyway, Renault makes some very nice cars, they just don't sell
'em in N. America!

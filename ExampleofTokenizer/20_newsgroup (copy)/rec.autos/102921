hmmmm.. not sure, since no such beast exists.. i can tell you another
though..  you won't catch me dead in a GMC Syclone or Typhoon either,
1000 bhp or not.. not even the fact that Clint Eastwood has one.  just
my taste,  no rational reasons for it.

CAR just tested the S4 wagon with 5 banger and 6 speed manual.  Rave
review except for Servotronic..  Audi is trying to recoup the
development costs for the V8, and since the V8 is not selling well,
they are sticking it into the 100 series cars.. Neat marketing trick,
eh?  yeah, a 100 V8-32v wouldn't be a bad idea as competition for the
upcoming bimmer 530/540i would it?  maybe they can use a 3.6 liter
version to avoid conflicts with the v8 model.. then strip off all the
luxo-garbage.  let the S4 remain with the flared arches and fat tires
to go fight with the M5.... maybe turn up the boost a wee bit to bump
bhp up to say 450 or so.. :-) while keeping the 100 V8 with mercedes
500E style subtlety.

blah blah blah....

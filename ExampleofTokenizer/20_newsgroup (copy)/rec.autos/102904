Stuff deleted...

I am sorry to report that in Southern California it was a sick sport
for a while to drop concrete blocks from the overpasses onto the
freeway.  Several persons were killed when said blocks came through
their windshields.  Many overpass bridges are now fenced, and they
have made it illegal to loiter on such bridges (as if that would stop
such people).  Yet many bridges are NOT fenced.  I always look up at a
bridge while I still have time to take evasive action even though this
*sport* has not reached us here in Fresno.

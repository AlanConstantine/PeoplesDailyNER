I used to have a '67 Galaxie convertible, was sitting at a light waiting
for it to turn green. It turned green, but I hesitated a little (sleeping I
guess) and a bird bombed me, it landed directly in front of me at eye
level, I guess the bird miscalculated and thought I was going to take off
right away.

And I'm still trying to figure out the one I got under my rear bumper as
well ?!?!?! Was the bird flying up and doing fancy acrobatics at my car and
decided to drop one while executing a perfect loop??

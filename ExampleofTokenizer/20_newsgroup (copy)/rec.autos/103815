Well, the Opel deal fell through...

Now i'm looking at a Datsun 240Z for sale in our local buy&sell.  Any
previous owners have any experience with these cars?  Besides looking
for rust,good compression,low miles, and all the other usual car
things one looks for, is there anything special about these cars that
I should watch out for?

How about things like handling,performance,mileage,etc.  These cars
look hot, to my eyes at least, and bear more than a passing
resemblance to the Aston Martin DB4 Zagato(sp?), which has to be one
of the most beatiful cars ever made.

What is the difference between 240Z, 260Z, 280Z?  The 280ZX is rather 
unappealing IMHO, but the other cars are decent.
Thanks again...

What I was trying to say was that if you plan to blow by somebody at a very HIGH speed differential and you assume you are safe because the guy sees you, you are stupid (of course, it depends on the circumstances).  I have had some VERY scary instances when I assumed this and I dont think all of the fault was the other guy (now if he was going 25 in a 55 thats a whole different story)

ok.  I can agree to this, because, as we have both proved, what is ideally
SUPPOSED to happen, isn't always.  And even though i'm rearely the one doing
the passing, i don't see where it makes you stupid, but i agree, that if you 
think you are SAFE, because the other guy is SUPPOSED to have been paying 
attention, then yes, you are just as dumb as the other(maybe dumber?)

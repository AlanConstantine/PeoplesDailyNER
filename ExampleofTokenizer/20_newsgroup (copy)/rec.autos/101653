Quoting Jeffrey J. Nucciarone's (nucci@microwave.gsfc.nasa.gov) article 
<C4G8Hv.Cs4@skates.gsfc.nasa.gov> of 04-06-93, in pertinent part:

Brake rotors and the clutch are the main things.  There has been a clutch 
replacement program; you might check to see if the car is still eligible, 
as it is a change well worth making.  You can also swap the cruddy cable 
shifter for the newer rod shifter, also a change worth making, but that'll 
cost you some $$.

My brakes usually do one wibble-wobble on startup, so that is probably 
normal.  Didn't know they had a self-test, that's interesting.

What kind of tires does the car have on it?

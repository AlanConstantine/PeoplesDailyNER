Of course you are a bunch of arrogant lawyers who know whats best for the 
rest of us. You are doing such a wonderful job with our judicial system,
getting all the criminals off, I bow to your superior intellect. Not to
mention the fees you collect from us poor slobs who get tickets from 
speeding State Police officers, so you can soak is when we go to court.
I just love lawyer jokes! Don't you?

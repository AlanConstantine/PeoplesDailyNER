	I was hoping for something like "The chassis exhibits X 
degrees of flex when subjected to forces of more than Y units.
Forces of more than Y units begin to manifest at Z miles per hour."

	Not "Well, gee, it wasn't designed to go fast because, uhh,
well, gee, it wasn't designed to go fast.  It's not a Porsche, you
know".

	Well, as compared to the normal Taurus, the SHO comes
with more supportive seats,better brakes,a stiffer suspension,
different tires, and a body design that takes advantage of aero
effects to keep the car on the ground (or at least I think that's
what all that boy-racer plastic is for).  You're kidding yourself if
you think any car on the road has a passenger compartment made to
withstand 130 MPH impacts.  

>Compare either to the Porsche 911 and you tell me which was designed

	Oh, right.  Only 120,000 dollar cars should be driven fast.
They drive goddamn Rabbits at 120 MPH in Europe, pal, and I reckon
a Taurus is at least as capable as a Rabbit.

>certainly haven't convinced me.

	Of course not.  "Speeding-is-bad.  Speeding-is-illegal. 
I-will-not-speed.  I-love-Big-Brother."  You had your mind made up
already.

	It's interesting that lots of the roads out west had *NO*
speed limits until 1975.

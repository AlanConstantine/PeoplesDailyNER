--When I was selling Nissans last summer, I sold a '92 SE-R in early August
  when its supply was getting quite scarce.  The car was black with ABS, 
  Value Option Pkg, and power moonroof.  I sold it for $12,900 plus tax.
  Naturally, my manager didn't really care to sell one of the most desirable
  SE-R's for virtually no profit (to the best of my knowledge).....

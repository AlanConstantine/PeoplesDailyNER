According to _The Complete Guide To Specialty Cars_, 7th Edition, from
Crown Publishing, it's the VW Kubelwagen (w/ 2 dots over the 'u').
The company is:

   Wolfkam
   P.O. Box 1608, Vika
   0119 Oslo 1, Norway

   011-47-30-26601 voice line
   011-47-2-166138 FAX line


An excerpt from the blurb:

   ...This fine Kubel clone from Wolfkam is a very close copy of
   the original, and offers the same all-weather and cross-country
   capabilities as its WWII forebears.  The robust fiberglass body
   kit is very complete, and includes all the hardware you will
   need, except for your own VW donor car.  The phone number [...]
   is the entire AT&T dialing sequence; call and ask for Karl
   Torum, or send $5 cash or _International Money Order_
   for a complete literature package.


George.

P.S., I'd be happy to share what info I have on other kit cars and
      kit car manufacturers.

P.P.S., I'm looking for a used or partially completed Porsche 356
        Speedster Convertible D replica from Intermeccanica.  I'd
        appreciate any leads or advice/stories from any owners
        out there.

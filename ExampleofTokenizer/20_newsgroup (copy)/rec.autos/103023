Thanks to everyone who responded to my Honda Accord break question.
It does seem that the master cylinder is bad. I will have my
mechanic double check and be sure it isn't something simpler
and cheaper first, but from your responses it sounds like it
is very likely to be the master cylinder.

Thanks everyone!!

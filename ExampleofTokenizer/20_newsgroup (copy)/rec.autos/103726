 I don't think that a transmission fluid change will solve your problem.
 Unless you are in an extremely cold climate and using a very heavy weight
 fluid.  Follow the manufacturer's recommended oil weight.  Some of the
 cars I have had (all standard transmissions 4 or 5 speeds) recommend
 changing the transmission fluid at 30,000 miles under normal driving
 conditions.  I've gone 100,000 without changing the transmission oil (and
 had to replace the transmission bearings!). My older cars used 85 weight
 oil whereas my 92 Honda uses 10-30 motor oil (or maybe 30 weight).

$Anybody keeping track of how many of these there are?  So far I have
$Miata, Tredia, Previa, Sentra, Maxima, Altima, Camry, and Justy, not to
$mention Lexus, Acura and Infiniti!  

   You're apparently including names that are, or appear to be,
derivatives of real words in English or some other language (e.g.
Acura, Infiniti, Maxima, Altima), in which case you missed ones such
as Integra, Supra, Allante', Capri and Calibra.  In Canada, add Serenia and
Precidia.  If you count misspellings, add Protege and (in Canada)
Vigor.  How about the forthcoming Mondeo, if it is given that name
in North America?

   Others might include Celica, Corolla, Paseo, and Tercel.  In Canada,
add Asu"na.

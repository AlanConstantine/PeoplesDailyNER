My last car had T-Tops (BIG T-Tops).  My current car is a convertible.
IMHO, if you're after that 'convertible feel', T-Tops, open-top,
sunroofs, moonroofs, whatever, just don't cut it.  There's no
substitute for a convertible.  If you're not after that sun beating
down on you, the wind in your hair and teeth, the flopsum and
jetsum getting in the car and the noises associated with the
whooshing of the wind, you're not after that 'convertible feel'.
So go with something with at least a hole above the driver but don't call
it a convertible.

And I do wonder how those targa tops would compare against my roll
bar in a rollover situation.  Of course, I'd rather not test it
in MY car.  I, too, am in my early 40s.

A convertible--accept no substitute.

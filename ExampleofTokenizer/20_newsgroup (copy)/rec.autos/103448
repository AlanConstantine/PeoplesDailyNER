AW>>>My 85 Caprice Classic with 120K+ miles has finally reached
  >>>the threshold of total number of mechanical problems that
  >>>I am forced to post :).  Anyone out there who might be
  >>>able to give me some pointers on one or more of the below,
  >>>please e-mail or post!

AW>>>1. When making turns, especially when accelerating,
  >>>there is usually a loud "thunk" from the rear of
  >>>of the car.  Sounds like it could be the differential.

Wheel bearing, ujoint.


AW>>>2. On starting the car, I get blue (oil) smoke from
  >>>the exhaust for 5-10 seconds.  Exhaust valves

Bad valve stem seals.

AW>>>3. Brakes.  More pedal travel than I feel comfortable
  >>>with, but master cylinder is full and fluid is

Worn pads, rear brakes not adjusted up tight or worn out drums.
90% of low pedal complaints usually are from a rear brake problem.

AW>>>4. Tranny.  Tranny problems seem to be slowly getting
  >>>worse -- takes almost 2 seconds to downshift from
  >>>3rd to 2nd on heavy throttle application, and more
  >>>recently, it is reluctant to shift from 2nd to 3rd.
  >>>Fluid (checked with car running with tranny put
  >>>through all the gears and then back to park, as per
  >>>Haynes manual) is red and clear, and is on full mark.
Possible modulator valve if equipped with one. Also could be the
kickdoen cable.

AW>>>5. My springs all around are just about shot -- I have
  >>>4 new shocks on, but car still skips out on bumps
  >>>in turns at moderate to high speed.  How hard are
  >>>they to change?  Can they be reconditioned?
Difficult on front. Easy on rear. They are not expensive. about $75-$100
for front and less than $50 for the rear.

Its also kind of dangerous to work on the front springs without the
proper equipment.

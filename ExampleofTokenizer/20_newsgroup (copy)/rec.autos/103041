My boss is interested in a new 300 series Mercedes Benz wagon.
Does anyone have any testimonial evidence and/or strong opinions
on this car (or line)?

Particularly, I would like to hear about power (manual t. only)
reliability, feel, and any unusually good or bad features of the
line.

She currently drives a VW Passat, and is being plagued by its
electrical problems.  The dealer claims there is nothing wrong,
even though the doors have a habit of locking and unlocking them-
selves while you are driving down the road.  The automatic shoulder
restraints also like to move back and forth as you move along.
She does not have the new, larger engine and is quite
dissatisfied with its lack of power.

The MB wagon would have to have more power and no peculiar problems
such as the Passat's electrical system.  She is also considering
a Saab 9000 (add some letters).  Any comparisons between the 9000
line and the Mercedes would be helpful.

Price is not an impediment.

You guys are correct.  The Bricklin was produced in Canada.
The National Museum of Science and Technology here in Ottawa
has one, and sometimes they put it on display.  Most of the time,
it stays in storage because the museum doesn't have much room.
It's a big deal for a car to be Canadian and that's why they 
have it.  If anybody's a fan, they also have a nice green '73
Riviera that looks like it just came out of the showroom.

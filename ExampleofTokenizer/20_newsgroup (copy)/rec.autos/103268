Does anyone know how to reset the service indicator of a BMW after changing
the oil yourself?

Also, I have about 3,000 miles on my 525i and so far only one of the five
yellow service indicators went out. That means I don't need oil service until
it reach approximatly 15,000 miles which doesn't make sense to me. Any idea?

PS of cause I did my first oil change at 1,200 miles

An unconventional remedy that you might try for altitude sickness in the Andes is
chewing coca leaves or taking teas made from coca leaves. You might notice that
many of the natives have wads in their mouths... the tea can be obtained in S.
American pharmacies. This remedy alleviates some of the lightheadedness and
dizziness - but don't try to jog with it. I've tried this when travelling and
hiking in Peru and Ecuador. The amount of cocaine you would ingest are too minute
to cause any highs...

Also it is a good idea to eat lightly and dress warm while adjusting to high altitudes.

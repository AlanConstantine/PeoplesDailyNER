I have been hearing bad thing about amalgam dental fillings.  Some say
the lead/ mercury leeches into your system and this is bad.  And I have
recently heard that there is some suspicion that the mercury is a breeding
ground for bacteria that will be resistant to antibiotics.   

My dentist wants to use an amalgam filling for me in a place where I have
two cavaties in one tooth and wants to use one filling to cover both.
He says that composite filling don't hold up well when they are large.
So, I would like to know if there are any other choices besides amalgam
and composite.  And, should I really even be worried about amalgam?  I
heard that some scandanavian country does not even use them any more- 
is this true.

Any information you can give me will be greatly appreciated.


Thanks!

Hi, I am doing a term paper on the syringe and I have found some
information.  It is said that Charles Pravaz has invented the hypodermic
needle, but then I have also found that Alexander Wood has invented it. 
Does anyone know which one it is, of if it was anyone else?  If there is
anymore information that is out there could you please send it to me.
Thank you very much.
Becky Olsen

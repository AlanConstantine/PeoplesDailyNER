I have a long sighted eye and a short sighted eye. My right eye tends
to cut out when I look at distant things, my left eye when I am close
up.  I had specs to balance things up a bit but could do without them.
I thought that, one way or another, I would always be able to see
clearly.  Unfortunately middle age is rearing its ugly head and I can
no longer see close up objects clearly.  Maybe it's just that my arms
are getting shorter :-)

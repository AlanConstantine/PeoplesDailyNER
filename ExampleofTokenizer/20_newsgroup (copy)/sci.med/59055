Hello,  I am not sure if this is the right conference to ask this
question, however, Here I go..  I am a commercial fisherman and I 
fell about 3 weeks ago down into the hold of the boat and broke or
cracked a rib and wrenched and bruised my back and left arm.
  My question,  I have been to a doctor and was told that it was 
best to do nothing and it would heal up with no long term effect, and 
indeed I am about 60 % better, however, the work I do is very 
hard and I am still not able to go back to work.  The thing that worries me
is the movement or "clunking" I feel and hear back there when I move 
certain ways...  I heard some one talking about the rib they broke 
years ago and that it still bothers them.ÿ.  any opinions?
thanx and cheers

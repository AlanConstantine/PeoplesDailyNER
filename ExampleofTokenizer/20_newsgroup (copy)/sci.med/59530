Have I mailed this to the correct newsgroup(s)? Are there other newsgroup(s)
which cover the following topic?
--------

Has anyone with myopia (short-sightedness) ever done the Bates eye-exercises?

If so, could you please e-mail me the following information:

	- age and state of sight before exercises were commenced;

	- type, frequency, and length of time spent on exercises performed;

	- improvements noticed immediately after performing exercises;

	- length of period before any improved sight deteriorates;

Thanks in advance for any replies. I'll summarise and post results if there's
enough interest.

 - Jonathan Goldstein

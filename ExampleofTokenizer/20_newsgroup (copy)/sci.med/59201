Hi...

I need information on scaring. Particularly as a result of grazing the skin
I really wanted to know of 

	1. would a scar occur as a result of grazing
	2. if yes, then would it disappear?
	3. how long does a graze take to heal?
	4. will hair grow on it once it has healed?
	5. what is 'scar tissue'?
	6. should antiseptic cream be applied to it regularly?
	7. is it better to keep it exposed and let fresh air at it?

Please help - any info - no matter how small will be appreciated greatly. 

BUT PLEASE E-MAIL ME DIRECTLY because I dont read this newsgroup often (this
is my first time).

Steve, take a look at what you are saying.  I don't see one construvtive
word here.  If you don't have anything constructive to add, why waste
the bandwidth - yeah, sure, flame me for doing it myself.  Is this
sci.med or alt.flame?  Like it or not, medical science does *not* know
categorically everything about everything.  I'm not flaming your
knowledge, just asking you to sit back and ask yourself "what if?"

"Minds are like parachutes - they only function when they are open."

Oh - and if you *do* want to flame me or anyone else, how about using
email?

Before more bandwidth gets wasted on this:

I APOLOGIZE for my flame.

First, because I distributed the message to so many newsgroups; I did
       not check the crosspostings of the article I followed up on.

Second, for not making my argument clear enough. I reacted to the tone
        of many of the anti-Kirlian posts, not to their content. Right
        or wrong, I found the arguments set in arrogant and sneering words
        (that includes "jokes"), which I still think is unwarranted.

And, obviously, I should not have done the same.

-- Alex

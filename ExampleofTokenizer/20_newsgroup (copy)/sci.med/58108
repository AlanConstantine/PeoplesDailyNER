Where did you read this?  I don't think this is true.  I think most
medical treatments are based on science, although it is difficult
to prove anything with certitude.  It is true that there are some
things that have just been found "to work", but we have no good
explanation for why.  But almost everything does have a scientific
rationale.  The most common treatment for prostate cancer is
probably hormone therapy.  It has been "proven" to work.  So have
radiation and chemotherapy.  What treatments did the article say
are not proven?

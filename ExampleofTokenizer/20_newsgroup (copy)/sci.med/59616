Darn.  Just when I think I understand something someone who knows the
pathology has to burst my bubble :-(  We'd better not start talking about
glomerular diseases, then I'll really get depressed.

Seriously though, I wonder how someone with CPH would end up getting a
biopsy in the first place?  My understanding (and feel free to correct me)
is that the enzymes are at worst mildly elevated, with overall normal
hepatic function.  I would think that the only clue might be a history of
prior HepB infection and a positive HepB-sAg.  Or is it indeed on a
continuum with CAH, and the distinction merely one of pathology and
prognosis, but otherwise identical clinical features?

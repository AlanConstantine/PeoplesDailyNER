As I recall from my bout with kidney stones, there isn't any
medication that can do anything about them except relieve the pain.

Either they pass, or they have to be broken up with sound, or they have
to be extracted surgically.

When I was in, the X-ray tech happened to mention that she'd had kidney
stones and children, and the childbirth hurt less.

Demerol worked, although I nearly got arrested on my way home when I barfed
all over the police car parked just outside the ER.

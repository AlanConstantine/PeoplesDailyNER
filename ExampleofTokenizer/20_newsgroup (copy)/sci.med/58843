I don't react to scallops, but did have discomforts with clam juice
served at (American) waterfront seafood bars.  I don't know whether
the juice is homemade or from cans.

The following is my first encounter with the Chinese Restaurant
Syndrome.  Ten years ago, about an hour after having Won Ton Soup I
collapsed in a chair with my face feeling puffed up, my scalp
tingling, my feet too weak to stand up.  The symptoms lasted for about
20 minutes.  Determined to find out the cause of my first reaction, I
went back to the Chinese restuarant and ordered the same dish.  The
same thing happened.  A quick look inside the kitchen revealed nothing
out of the ordinary.

I've also had a mild attack after having soup at a Thai restuarant.

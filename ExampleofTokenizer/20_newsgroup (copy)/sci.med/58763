And to add further fuel to the flame war, I read about 20 years ago that
the "natural" MSG - extracted from the sources you mention above - does not
cause the reported aftereffects; it's only that nasty "artificial" MSG -
extracted from coal tar or whatever - that causes Chinese Restaurant
Syndrome.  I find this pretty hard to believe; has anyone else heard it?

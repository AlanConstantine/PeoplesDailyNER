Because one simply _can't_ cook on the net, nor can one cook while ON the
net.  Cooking is best done IN a kitchen, ON a stove.  (Gotcha! *grin*)

 who seem to expect packaged food to conform to their tastes.  In other

I don't have strong feelings about additives, as long as I can't taste 'em.

(As for the rest of your reply to me, I am sorry it it seemed as if i was 
 picking on you.  I wasn't trying to do so.  Please accept my apologies.)

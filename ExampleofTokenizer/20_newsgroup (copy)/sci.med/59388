Dear Netters:

Maybe one of you can explain this.  From time to time I experience 
a strange kind of feeling (I have all kinds of weird feelings) which 
can be best described as the feeling of "losing gravity", like that one 
experiences in a descending elevator.  Needless to say, it is not 
enjoyable.  It sometimes comes with shortness of breath and extreme 
fatigue.  It lasts from a few minutes to an hour and when it lasts 
that long, it makes me sweatening.

Initially I called it "palpitation (spelling?)" until I later learnt that 
the terminology has been reserved for the self-awareness of heart beats.

So, is there a specific term for this feeling, or am I a stragne person?
I always believe I am unique. 

Thanks.

Ping

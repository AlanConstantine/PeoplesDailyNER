Yeah, the "Feingold Diet" is a load of crap.  Children diagnosed with ADD
who are placed on this diet show no improvement in their intellectual and
social skills, which in fact continue to decline.  Of course, the parents
who are enthusiastic about this approach lap it up at the expense of their
children's development.  So much for the value of "interesting anecdotal
results".  People will believe anything if they want to.

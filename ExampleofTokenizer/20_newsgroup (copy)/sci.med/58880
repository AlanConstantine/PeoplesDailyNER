I have bad luck and got a VD called <Granuloma ingunale>, which involves
the growth of granules in the groin.  I found out about it by checking medicine
books and I found the prescriptions.  And I know I can just go to a clinic to
get it cured.  BUT unfortunately I am serving my duty in the army right now and
I think it's impossible to prevent anyone from knowing this if I take leaves 
every day for two weeks for treatment.  Thus I bought the prescribed tablets
at some drugstore, but to cure it I must get INJECTION of <Streptomycin>, with
a dose of 1g every 12 hours, for at least 10 days.  I can probably buy the 
tools and this solution somewhere but I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO INJECTION BY MYSELF
!
Can any kind people here tell me:

If it's possible to do it? Can I do it on my arm? or it must be done on the hip
only??  Any info is welcome and please write me or post your help SOON!! (I am
already taking the tablets ..and I can't wait!!)

Please don't flame me for posting this, and don't judge me. I've learned a 
lesson and all I need now is REAL MEDICAL HELP.

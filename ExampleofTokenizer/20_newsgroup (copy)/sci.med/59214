True.

Also True.

Not really.  

Kirlian photography is taking pictures of the corona discharge from
objects (animate or inanimate).  The fields applied to the objects are
millions of times larger than any biologically created fields.  If you
want to record the biologically created electric fields, you've got to
use low-noise, high-gain sensors typical of EEGs and EKGs.  Kirlian
photography is just phun-with-physics type stuff (right up there with
soaking chunks of extra-fine steel wool in liquid oxygen then hitting
them with a hammer -- which, like a Kirlean setup, is fun but possibly
dangerous).

: organisms when better understood. Perhaps not.

Probably not.

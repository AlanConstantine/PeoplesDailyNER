EDTA(chelation therapy) has been used by some physicians to try to remove 
calcium from calcified plaques in the arterial system(not approved for such 
use).  There is also the possibility that lung tissue in patients with lung 
disease has become calcified(chest x-rays would show this).  There are side
-effects to the use of EDTA because it is not specific for calcium(it also 
binds other minerals).  I think that there have been some deaths when 
EDTA chelation therapy has been used because of mineral imbalances that 
were not detected and corrected.  In animal studies, the best way to remove 
calcium from plaques in rabbits was to supplement the rabbits with vitamin C 
and magnesium(rabbits already synthesize their own vitamin C, the extra 
vitamin C was given in their diets to help the magnesium displace the calcium 
from the plaques).

The calcification process that occurs in both plaques and the lung probably 
can be prevented if magnesium is used in supplemental form.  Most patietns 
with calcium deposits are found to be deficient in calcium.

	1. "Magnesium interrationships in ischemic heart disease: A review"
	   Am J Clin Nutr 27(1):59-79(1974).  Supplementation with 
	   magnesium will prevent clacification of blood vessels. 

	2. "The importance of magnesium deficiency in cardiovascular 
	    disease" Am. Heart J 94:649-57(1977).  The need to measure the 
	    serum concentration in all patients with heat disease cannot be 
	    overemphasized.  This is a review article.

	3. "Effect of dietary magnesium on development of atherosclerosis 
	   in cholesterol-fed rabbits" Atherosclerosis 10:732-7(1990).  
	   Magnesium supplementation greatly decreased the formation of 
	   plaques in rabbits feed a diet that had 1% by weight cholesterrol 
	   added to their normal food.

Since EDTA will also bind magnesium, I've never really liked it's use for 
the reversal of athersclerosis or now apparently in emphesema patients.

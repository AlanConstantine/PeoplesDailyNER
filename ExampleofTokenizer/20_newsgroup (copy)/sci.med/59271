Which points up the "studies" made by amateurs:  Did you ALSO check EVERY TIME
YOU DID *NOT* get sick?  "No," you say?  Why not check every thing you eat when
you don't get sick and find out how much MSG you're actually consuming?

If you knew enough about what the test was about to decide that you didn't want
to participate because it involved MSG, you'd've already made yourself
ineligible (since MSG IS detectable by taste). How can anybody be so clueless
as to what double blind studies are all about?

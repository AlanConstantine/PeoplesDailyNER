I am looking for information on possible causes and long term effects
of bone marrow sclerosis. I would also be thankful if anyone reading
this newsgroup could list some recognized treatment centers if anything
else than massive blood transfusion can be effective. If you plan on
a "go to the library"-style reply, please be kind enough to add a list 
of suggested topics or readings: Medicine is not my field.

Regards,
Joel Malard.

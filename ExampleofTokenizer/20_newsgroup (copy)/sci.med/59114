My insurance company encourages annual physicals, and at my age [42] i'm
thinking that BIannual physicals, at least, might be a good idea.  Therefore,
i'm shopping for a GP.  Might as well get a good one.

Could the Assembled Net Wisdom suggest things i should look for, or point me to
the FAQ archive if on this topic if there is one?  

Please EMail; i suspect that this topic is real Net Clutter bait.

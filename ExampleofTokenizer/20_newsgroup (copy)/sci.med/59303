Perhaps I should quit eating mushrooms, soya beans, and brie cheese
which all have MSG in them.  It occurs naturally.

I'm not going to quit eating something that I like just because
it *might* cause me trouble later or causes problems in *some*
people.  I would much rather avoid stress by not worrying over
what goes in my mouth and not spending every day reading conflicting
reports of what is good/bad for you.

I may eat some things in quantities that may not be good for me.
Fine.  I've made my decision and I don't think it's appropriate
for anyone to try to 'convert' me.  "It's for your own good" are
the most obnoxious and harmful words, IMO, in the English (or
any other) language.

I think it is.  I get tired of people saying 'don't eat X because
it's BAD!'  Well, X may not be bad for everyone.  And even if
it is, so what?  Give people all the information but don't ram
your decisions down their throats.

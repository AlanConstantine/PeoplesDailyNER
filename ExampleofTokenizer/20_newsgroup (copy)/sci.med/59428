Does anyone know how posionous centipedes and millipedes are? If someone
was bitten, how soon would medical treatment be needed, and what would
be liable to happen to the person?

(Just for clarification - I have NOT been bitten by one of these,  but my
house seems to be infested, and I want to know 'just in case'.)

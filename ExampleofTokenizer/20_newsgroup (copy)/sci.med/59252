The burden of proof rests upon those who claim the existence
of this "syndrome".  To date, these claims are unsubstantiated
by any available data.  Hopefully, as a scientist, you would
take issue with anyone overstating their conclusions based
upon their data.

Gee, I have many interesting and enlightening anecdotes about
myself, my friends, and my family, but in the practice of
medicine I expect and demand more rigorous rationales for
basing therapy than "Aunt Susie's brother-in-law ...".

Anecdotal evidence may provide inspiration for a hypothesis,
but rarely proves anything in a positive sense.  And unlike
mathematics, boolean logic rarely applies directly to medical
issues, and so evidence of 'exceptions' does not usually
disprove but rather modifies current concepts of disease.

I would characterize it not as 'abject disbelief' but rather 
'scientific outrage over vastly overstated conclusions'.

I have no problem with such an approach; but this is NOT what
is happening in the 'trenches' of this diagnosis.

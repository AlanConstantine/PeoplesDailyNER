My doc handed me 10mg samples of CLARITIN (brand of Ioratadine Tablet
from Schering Corp.)  I tried to find it in the PDR to no avail. I
do remember she mentioned this drug was relatively new to the US but
available overseas for quite some time.

Looking mostly for side-effect, contraindications, and mode of action 
such that it differs from Seldane and Hismanal.

Email or newsgroup is fine. Thanx in advance.

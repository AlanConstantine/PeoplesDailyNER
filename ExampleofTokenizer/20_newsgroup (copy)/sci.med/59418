You can also replicate the effect with a rock:  Take your first Kirlian
photograph.  Then moisten one edge of the rock.  Lo! and behold!  Phantom rock!

Disclaimer:  Hey, I understand VAXen and VMS.  That's what I get paid for.  My
understanding of astronomy is purely at the amateur level (or below).  So
unless what I'm saying is directly related to VAX/VMS, don't hold me or my
organization responsible for it.  If it IS related to VAX/VMS, you can try to
hold me responsible for it, but my organization had nothing to do with it.

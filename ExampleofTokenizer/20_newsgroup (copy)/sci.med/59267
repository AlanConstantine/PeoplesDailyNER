Does anyone know of research done on the use of haldol in the elderly?  Does 
short-term use of the drug ever produce long-term side-effects after
the use of the drug?  My grandmother recently had to be hospitalized
and was given large doses of haldol for several weeks.  Although the
drug has been terminated, she has changed from a perky, slightly
senile woman into a virtual vegetable who does not talk to anyone
and who cannot even eat or brush her teeth without assistance.  It
seems incredible to me that such changes could take place in the
course of just one and one-half months.  I have to believe that the
combination of the hospital stay and some drug(s) are in part
catalysts for this.  Any comments?

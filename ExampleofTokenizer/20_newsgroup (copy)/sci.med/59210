I was there in 1976.  I suppose it must have died out since 1946,
then.  Certainly I never heard of any homeopaths or herbalists in
the employ of the NHS.  Perhaps the law codified it but the authorities
refused to hire any homeopaths.  A similar law in the US allows
chiropractors to practice in VA hospitals but I've never seen one
there and I don't know of a single VA that has hired a chiropractor.
There are a lot of Britons on the net, so someone should be able to
tell us if the NHS provides homeopaths for you.

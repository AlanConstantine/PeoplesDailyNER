>Hi, We are trying to develop a image reconstruction simulation for the skull.  The problem we are having is that we cannot obtain 3D data for the skull.  We can just video a rotating skull, but that will only give us 2 dimensions.

>Anyone out there got any suggestions?

Yup, you can get a skull contained in the Cyberware_demo from the
following location:

In order to get the Cyberware_demo via ftp do the following:

	1) ftp taurus.cs.nps.navy.mil
	2) login as anonymous, guest as the password
	3) cd pub/dabro
	4) binary
	5) get cyberware_demo.tar.Z

Once you get the demo onto your workstation:

	1) uncompress cyberware_demo.tar.Z
	2) tar xvof cyberware_demo.tar

The skull data is called 'phred' and resides in the data directory.

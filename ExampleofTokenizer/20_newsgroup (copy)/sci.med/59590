I remember as a kid visiting my relatives on Kauai, and one of the things
that really frightened me was centipedes.  I'd been told they were poisonous
and infrequently one would pop up and scare the heck out of me.  Once
one came out of the vacuum cleaner and it seemed like it was at least a foot
long and moving at 35 miles an hour!

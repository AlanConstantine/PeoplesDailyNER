     Following a series of miscarriages, my wife was given a transfusion of
my white cells. (The theory as I understand it is that there is some kind
of immune blocking that prevents the body from attacking the pregnancy as
it normally would a "foreign" body. Where this blocking is deficient, the
body evicts the "intruder", resulting in a miscarriage. The white cells
apparently enhance the blocking capability.) Following the transfusion, she
successfully carried the next pregnancy to term, and Jake is now an active
9 month-old who cannot wait to walk.
     We're now thinking about having another child, but no one (including
the OBGYN who supervised the first transfusion) really seems to know
whether or not the transfusion process needs to be repeated for successive
pregnancies.
     Is there anyone in net-land who has experience with this?
Thanks...Gene (and Jane and Jake)

P.S. I've also posted this in misc.kids.

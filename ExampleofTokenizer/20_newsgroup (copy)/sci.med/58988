I think that's the correct spelling..
	I am looking for any information/supplies that will allow
do-it-yourselfers to take Krillean Pictures. I'm thinking
that education suppliers for schools might have a appartus for
sale, but I don't know any of the companies. Any info is greatly
appreciated.
	In case you don't know, Krillean Photography, to the best of my
knowledge, involves taking pictures of an (most of the time) organic
object between charged plates. The picture will show energy patterns
or spikes around the object photographed, and depending on what type
of object it is, the spikes or energy patterns will vary. One might
extrapolate here and say that this proves that every object within
the universe (as we know it) has its own energy signature.

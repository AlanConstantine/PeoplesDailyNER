	I've read mixed opinions on this.  Singed meat can contain
carcinogens, but unless you eat barbecued meat every meal, you're
probably not at much risk.  I think I will live life on the edge and
grill my food.

	I've also read that using petroleum based charcoal starter can
put some unwanted toxins in your food, or at least unwanted odor.
I've been using egg carton cups dipped in paraffin for fire starters,
and it actually lights faster and easier than lighter fluid.  Several
people have told me that they have excellent results with a chimney,
basically a steel cylinder with wholes punched in the side.  I've been
meaning to get one of these, but one hasn't presented itself while
I've been out shopping.  You can make one from a coffee can, but I buy
my coffee as whole beans in a bag, so I haven't had a big enough can
laying around.

Hi there
I'm suffering from Sarcoidosis at present.  Although it's shown as a
chronic & rare tissue disorder, it is thankfully NOT life threatening.

The very worsed thing that can happen to a non-treated sufferer is
glaucoma.  My specialists are bombarding me with Prednisolone E.C. (a
cortico-steriod) and after four months at 20mg a day, it's totally done
away with my enlarged lymph glands, so somethings happening for the
good!

Cheers Nigel

Why do you think he would be called a quack?  The quacks don't do cultures.
They poo-poo doing more lab tests:  "this is Lyme, believe me, I've
seen it many times.  The lab tests aren't accurate.  We'll treat it
now."  Also, is Dr. N's practice almost exclusively devoted to treating
Lyme patients?  I don't know *any* orthopedic surgeons who fit this
pattern.  They are usually GPs.

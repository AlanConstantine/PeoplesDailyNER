 Someone please help me. I am searching to find out (as many others may)
an absolute 'cure' to removing all detectable traces of marijuana from
a persons body. Is there a chemical or natural substance that can be
ingested or added to urine to make it undetectable in urine analysis.
If so where can these substances be found. 

            If you know this information, please Email me directly
             
                Thank You Kindly for your support,


                         Randy

The following 4 addresses are on the LymeNet mailing list, but are rejecting
mail.  Since the list server originally accepted these addresses successfully,
I assume these addresses have since been eliminated.  Improperly functioning
mail gateways might also be responsible.

If you are listed here and would still like to remain on the list, please
write to me.  Otherwise, I will remove these addresses from the list before the
next newsletter goes out.

As a general rule, please remember to *unsubscribe* from all your mailing
lists before your account is closed.  This will save the listserv maintainer
from many headaches.

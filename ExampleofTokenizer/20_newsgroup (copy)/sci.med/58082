It's got potential.  Instead of *.chemistry, how about splitting the
classification into *.biochemistry (which are probably the topics
you're thinking of) and *.pharmaceutical (which otherwise might end up
in *.(bio)chemistry)?

(This is separate from the issue of whether there is sufficient potential
news volume to support either or both groups.)

I'll add 'em to my medical/health newsgroup wish list (which I'm looking
forward to posting and discussing -- but not for another 10 days or so).

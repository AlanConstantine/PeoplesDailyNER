I heard a short blurb on the news yesterday about an herb called feverfew (?)
that some say is good for preventing migraines. I think the news said there
were two double-blind studies that found this effective.

Does anyone know about these studies? Or have experience with feverfew?
I'm skeptical, but open to trying it if I can find out more about this.
What is feverfew, and how much would you take to prevent migraines (if 
this is a good idea, that is)? Are there any known risks or side effects
of feverfew? 

Thanks in advance for any info!
Brenda

I have osteoarthritis, and my huband has just been diagnosed with diabetes
(type II, I guess--no insulin). 


I've been trying to read up on these two conditions, and what really
surprises me is how few experiments have been done and how little is known. 
Losing weight appears to be imperative for diabetes and advisable for
arthritis (at least, for -women- with arthritis), but, of course, the very
conditions that make weight loss advisable are part of the reason for the
weight gain. 

For myself, I'm almost afraid to lose weight, because no matter how gentle
and sensible a diet I use (the last one was 1800-2000 calories, in about
eight small meals), the weight won't go off gradually and stay off. 
Instead, it drops off precipitously, and then comes back on with much
interest, like bread on the waters.


With this experience, it's hard to be encouraging to my husband.  All I can
suggest is to make it as gradual as possible.

Meanwhile, some experts recommend no sugar, others, no fat, others, just a
balanced diet.  It's almost impossible to tell from their writings -which-
parts of their recommendations are supposed to help the condition, and
which are merely ideas the expert thinks are nifty.

Is it my imagination, or are these very old conditions very poorly
understood?  Is it just that I'm used to pediatrician-talk ("It's strep;
give him this and he'll get well.") and so my expectations are too high?

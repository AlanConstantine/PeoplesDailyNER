I beg to differ.  Chronic *active* hepatitis implies that the disease
remains active, and generally leads to liver failure.  At the very
minimum, the patient has persistently elevated liver enzymes (what some
call "transaminitis").  Chronic *persistant* hepatitis simply means that
the patient has HbSag in his/her blood and can transmit the infection, but
shows no evidence of progressive disease.  If I had to choose, I'd much
rather have the persistant type.

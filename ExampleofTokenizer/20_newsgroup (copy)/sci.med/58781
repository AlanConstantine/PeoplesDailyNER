Here is another anecdotal story.  I am a picky eater and never wanted to 
try chinese food, however, I finally tried some in order to please a
girl I was seeing at the time.  I had never heard of Chinese restaurant
syndrome.  A group of us went to the restaurant and all shared 6 different
dishes.  It didn't taste great, but I decided it wasn't so bad.  We went
home and went to bed early.  I woke up at 2 AM and puked my guts outs.
I threw up for so long that (I'm not kidding) I pulled a muscle in
my tongue.  Dry heaves and everything.  No one else got sick, and I'm
not allergic to anything that I know of.  

Suffice to say that I wont go into a chinese restaurant unless I am 
physically threatened.  The smell of the food makes me ill (and that *is*
a psycholgical reaction).  When I have been dragged in to suffer
through beef and broccoli without any sauces, I insist on no MSG.  
I haven't gotten sick yet.

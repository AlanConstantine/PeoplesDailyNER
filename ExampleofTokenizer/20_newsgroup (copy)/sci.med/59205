[Cross-posted from alt.psychology.personality since it talks about
 physician's personalities.  Apologies to sci.med readers not
 familiar with the Myers-Briggs "NT/NF" personality terms.  But,
 in a word or two, the NTs (iNtuitive->Thinkers) are approximately your
 philosophy/science/tech pragmatic types, and the NFs (iNtuitive-Feelers)
 are your humanities/social-"science"/theology idealistic types.  They
 hate each others' guts (:-)) but tend to inter-marry.
 The letter "J" is a reference to conscienciousness/decisiveness.]

Please get it right, Jon.
(This NTJ has a strong desire to correct semantic mistakes,
 because the NFs of this world are fouling the once-pristine NT
 intellectual nest with their verbal poop.)

The dominant correlation is NT <-> Phlegmatic (and _not_ NT <-> Choleric).
One of the semantic roots of "choleric" is the idea of "hot" (emotional)
and one of the semantic roots of "phlegmatic" is "cold" (unemotional).

Here is a thumbnail sketch (taken from Hans Eysenck, refering to Wundt)
relating the Ancient Greek quadratic typology with modern terms:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                 Emotional   
                                     ^
     ("Melancholic")                 |                     ("Choleric")
                                     |              
           Thoughtful Suspicious     |    Quickly-aroused Hotheaded
                  Unhappy Worried    |   Egocentric Histrionic
                           Anxious   |  Exhibitonist

I suspect that your characterisation of NTs as "choleric" is what
you psych-types call a "projection" of your own NF-ness onto us.

> Maybe we need more NF doctor's.  :^)

Perhaps in serious pediatics and "my little boy's got a runny
nose, doctor" general practice, but, please God, not in neurology,
opthamology, urology, etc. etc.  And NF-psychiatry should seperate
from NT-(i.e. real) psychiatry and be given a new name .. something 
like "channeling"  :-).

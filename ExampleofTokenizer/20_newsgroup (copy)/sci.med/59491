I have just started taking allergy shots a month ago and is 
still wondering what I am getting into. A friend of mine told
me that the body change every 7 years (whatever that means)
and I don't need those antibody-building allergy shots at all.
Does that make sense to anyone?

BTW, can someone summarize what is in the Consumer Report
February, 1988 article?

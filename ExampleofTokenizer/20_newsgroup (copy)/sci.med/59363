        Heck, I seem to feel like that *every* time I eat out. Including 
in the cafeteria at work. About half the time, the headache intensifies 
until nothing will make it go away except throwing up. Ick.

        As you might imagine, I don't eat out a lot. I guess my tolerance 
for food additives has plummeted since I switched to eating mostly 
steamed veggies. They're easy to fix, that's all.

        I won't even mention what happened the last time I ate corned 
beef. (Oops. Too late.)

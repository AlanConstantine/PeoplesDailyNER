My wife had hives during the first two months
of her pregnancy.  My son (3 months old), breast-fed,
now has the same symptoms.  She has been to a skin-specialist,
but he has merely prescribed various medicines (one
each visit as though by trial and error :-))

Anti-histamines worked on both of them, but looks like
becoming less effective.

Are there other solutions?  Thanks.

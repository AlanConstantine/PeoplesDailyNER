Years ago when I was an intern, an obese young woman was brought into
the ER comatose after having been reported to have grand mal seizures
why attending a "corn festival".  We pumped her stomach and obtained
what seemed like a couple of liters of corn, much of it intact kernals.  
After a few hours she woke up and was fine.  I was tempted to sign her out as
"acute corn intoxication."

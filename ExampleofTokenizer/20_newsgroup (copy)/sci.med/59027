    This has to be THE only, generally accepted, method of using common 
physics lab equipment to find certain answers to all the questions about
afterlifes, heavens, hells, purgatory, gods etc. Krillean photography
will probably be ignored as insignificant compared to these larger
eternal verities. Publishing your results could be a bit of a problem,
though.

I am looking for current sources for lists of all the home
medical tests currently legally available.
I believe this trend of allowing tests at home where
feasible, decreased medical costs by a factor of 10 or
more and allows the patient some time and privacy to
consider the best action from the results of such tests.
In fact I believe home medical tests and certain basic
tests for serious diseases such as cancer, heart disease,
should be offered free to the American public.
This could actually help to reduce national medical costs
since many would have an earlier opportunity to know
about and work toward recuperation or cure.

That's fine.  These words have multiple meanings.

As a self-proclaimed atheist, I believe that *some* conceptions
of god are inconsistent or in conflict with fact, and I lack
belief in other conceptions of god merely because there is no
reason for me to believe in these.  I usually use the word
agnostic to mean someone who believes that the existence of
a god is unknown inherently unknowable.  Note that this is a
positive belief that is quite different from not believing in a
god; I do not believe in a god, but I also do not believe the
agnostic claim.

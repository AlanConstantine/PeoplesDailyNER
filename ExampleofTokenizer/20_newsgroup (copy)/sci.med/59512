First off, use some decent terms if ya don't mind.  This is sci.med, not
alt.sex.

Secondly, how absolutely bogus to assume that "American's are just too hung
up on the penis....blah,blah".  I think most American's don't care about
anything so comlicated as that.  They just think it "looks nicer".  Ask 
a few of them and see what response you get.  Others still opt for
circumcision due to religious traditions and beliefs.  Some think it is
easier to clean.  Still others do it because "Daddy was".

Dont' be so naive as to think American's are afraid of sexuality. 

My son is not circumcised, and I can vouch for the argument that it is
more difficult to keep clean than a circumcised kids'.  Not so much that
the foreskin is difficult to pull back (it isn't) but because my son
doesn't want to wait long enough for a thorough check for smega or misplaced
feces.  So, many times it just gets a once over dab.  It worries me
that he might get an infection due to his lack of cooperation.  I am
sure, however, that he will be able to handle cleaning under the foreskin
himself once he is old enough.  Until, there is always the decision at
each diaper change...is this the time to clean or can we wait till next
time.

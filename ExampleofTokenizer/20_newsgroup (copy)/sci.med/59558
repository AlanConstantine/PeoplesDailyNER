I would like to know if their is any medical consensus
(or consensus within this group) regarding the ethics
of the following:

  1: Prescription of placebo medications when the patient
     did not specifically request any sort of treatment.

  2: Selling a placebo medication for a profit.

  3: Prescribing homeopathic remedies without advising
     a patient of their "controversial nature".

  4: Representing homeopathic remedies as "over the counter"
     medications.

Thanks,
Nick Ingegneri

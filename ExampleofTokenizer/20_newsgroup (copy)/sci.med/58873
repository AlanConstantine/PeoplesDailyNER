Obviously, it wouldn't be of much help to treat one problem by knowingly 
introducing another.  Cancer mestastizes.  My imperfect understanding of 
the facts are that gonadal cancer is particularly dangerous in this regard. 
I haven't done the research on it, but I don't recall ever hearing of a 
case of cancer being transmitted by a blood transfusion.  Probably just a 
common sense kind of arbitrary precaution.  Transmissable diseases like 
malaria though are obviously another story.

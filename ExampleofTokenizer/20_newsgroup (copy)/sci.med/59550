Well, that post was not that accurate.  People with early life hernias
are felt to have a congenital sack that promotes the formation of hernias.
The hernias of later life may be more associated with chronic straining.  
However, the risk of damage to the intestine without an operation is 
high enough that it ought to be repaired.  The risk of cancer is probably
no higher than the general population, but since you are near 40, it would
be sensible to have some sort of cancer screening, such as a flexible
sigmoidoscopy.  Sorry for the misleading info.

GT> Hi, We are trying to develop a image reconstruction simulation for the skull

You could do high resolution CT (computed tomographic) scanning of
the skull.  Many CT scanners have an algorithm to do 3-D
reconstructions in any plane you want.  If you did reconstructions
every 2 degrees or so in all planes, you could use the resultant
images to create user-controlled animation.

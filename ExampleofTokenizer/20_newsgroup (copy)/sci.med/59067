There is a person on the FIDO CFS echo who claims that he was 
cured of CFS by taking accutane.  He also claims that you are 
using it in the treatment of Fibromyalgia Syndrome.  Are you 
using accutane in the treatment of Fibromyalgia Syndrome?  Have 
you used it for CFS?  Have you gotten good results with it?  Are 
you aware of any double blind studies on the use of accutane in 
these conditions?  Thank you in advance for all replies.

... I think they should rename Waco TX to Wacko TX!

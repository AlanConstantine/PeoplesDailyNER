   News Advisory:

   Results of the largest heart attack study ever undertaken,
the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and t-PA for Occluded
Coronary Arteries trial (GUSTO), will be presented Friday, April
30, at the Clinical Research Meeting.
   A press conference will be held at 12:30 p.m.
   GUSTO evaluates the most aggressive emergency-room treatment
strategies available to clear blocked heart arteries and restore
blood flow to the heart, a process called thrombolysis.  The
thrombolytic strategies compared in GUSTO use powerful drugs to break
up blood clots in heart vessels quickly and prevent clots from
recurring.  These strategies have never been compared directly in a
large-scale clinical trial until GUSTO.  The results are expected to
have an important impact on heart attack treatment worldwide.
   The press conference will be held at two locations: live at the
National Press Club, Main Lounge, 13th Floor, 529 14th St., N.W.,
Washington D.C., and via satellite at The Hotel Macklowe, 145 W. 44th
Street, 4th Floor, New York City, between Broadway and 6th Avenue.
   GUSTO results will be presented by Eric Topol M.D., GUSTO Study
Chairman, professor and chairman of the Department of Cardiology at
The Cleveland Clinic Foundation; Robert Califf, M.D., clinical
director, GUSTO Coordinating Center and Associate Professor of
Medicine at Duke University Medical Center; and Allan Ross, M.D.,
coordinator of the GUSTO Angiographic Substudy and professor and
director of the Division of Cardiology at The George Washington
University Medical Center.

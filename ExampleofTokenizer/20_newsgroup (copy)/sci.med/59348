>>>Can men get yeast infections? Spread them? What kind of symptoms?

My ENT doctor told me that it is not uncommon for the wife to get a vaginal
yeast infection after the husband takes antibiotics.  In fact this recently
happened to my wife.  Explanation is that the antibiotics kill the yeast's
competition, they then thrive and increased yeast around the penis spread
the infection during intercourse.  I was on ceclor for 30 days, then my wife
got the yeast.

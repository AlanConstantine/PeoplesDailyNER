If you think you have kidney stones or your doctor tells you that you do,
DEFINITELY follow up on it.  My sister was diagnosed with kidney stones
1 1/2 years ago and given medication to take to dissolve them.  After that
failed and she continued to be in great pain, they decided she had
endometriosis.  When they did exploratory surgery, they discovered she
had a tumor, which turned out to be rhabdomyosarcoma -- a very rare 
and agressive cancer.  I realize this is not what happens in the majority
of cases, but you never know what can happen and shouldn't take chances!

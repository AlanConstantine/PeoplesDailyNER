I can't answer most of your questions, but I've seen it happen in 
family members who are being treated with radiation and/or chemotherapy.
Jory Graham published a cookbook many years ago (in cooperation with 
the American Cancer Society, I think) called "Something has to taste
good" (as I recall).

The cookbook was just what we needed several times when favorite foods
suddenly became "yech".

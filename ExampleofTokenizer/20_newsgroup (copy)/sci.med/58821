	I was kind of half watching Street Stories last night
	and one of the segments was about this doctor in
	S.F. who provides a service of investigating treatment
	for various diseases. I'm pretty sure his name is
	Dr. Mark Renniger (sp?) or close to that. 
	Did anyone else watch this? I'd like to get his
	correct name and address/phone number if possible.
	Thanks.

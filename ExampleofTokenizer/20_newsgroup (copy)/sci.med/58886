Some recent postings remind me that I had read about risks 
associated with the barbecuing of foods, namely that carcinogens 
are generated. Is this a valid concern? If so, is it a function 
of the smoke or the elevated temperatures? Is it a function of 
the cooking elements, wood or charcoal vs. lava rocks? I wish 
to know more. Thanks.

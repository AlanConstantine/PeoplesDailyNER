In the Monday, May 10 morning edition of the San Jose Mercury News an
article by Sandra Gonzales at the top of page 12A explained convicted
killer David Edwin Mason's troubled childhood saying,

	"Raised in Oakland and San Lorenzo by strict fundamentalist
	Christian parents, Mason was beaten as a child.  He once was
	tied to a workbench and gagged with a cloth after he accidently
	urinated on his mother when she walked under his bedroom window,
	court records show."

Were the San Jose Mercury news to come out with an article starting with
"Raised in Oakland by Mexican parents, Mason was beaten...", my face would
be red with anger over the injustice done to my Mexican family members and
the Mexican community as a whole.  I'm sure Sandra Gonzales would be equally
upset.

Why is it that open biggotry like this is practiced and encouraged by the
San Jose Mercury News when it is pointed at the christian community?

Can a good christian continue to purchase newspapers and buy advertising in
this kind of a newspaper?  This is really bad journalism.

I'm upset.

                      OUR FOUNDING FATHERS SAID...

     George Washington:  "I now make it my earnest prayer that God...
         (A.D. 1783)     would be pleased to dispose us all to do
                         justice, to love mercy, and to demean
     ourselves with charity and humility, and a pacific temper of mind,
     which were characteristics of the Divine Author of our blessed
     Religion, and without an humble imitation of Whose example in
     these things, we can never hope to be a happy nation."


     John Adams:  "It must be felt that there is no national security
     (A.D. 1853)  but in the nation's humble, acknowledged dependence
                  upon God and His overruling providence."


     Abraham Lincoln:   "It is the duty of nations, as well as of men,
       (A.D. 1863)      to own their dependence upon the overruling
                        power of God, to confess their sins and
     transgressions...and to recognize the sublime truth, announced in
     the Holy Scriptures and proven by all history, that those nations
     only are blessed whose God is the Lord..."

Yes, in fact Peter is now at Wycliffe HQ in the U.K., and is a member of my
church. I would fully endorse the above -- Peter is a very Godly man, with a
passion for serving Christ.

On one occasion he specifically addressed the issue of ``cultural
interference'' in a sermon, presumably from his experience of allegations
directed at Wycliffe. (Perhaps I could find the tape...?)

Like most topics, we've been through this one before, but here is
a good start:  Matthew 25:46:

"Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous
to eternal life."

I may post more on this subject when I have more time.  In any

are a bad way to proceed.  There are passages consistent with
either theory.  The sensible way to proceed is to look at them
all, and see if we can come up with a view that encompasses all
of them.  --clh]

After reading the posts on this newsgroup for the pasts 4 months, it 
has become apparent to me that this group is primarily active with 
Liberals, Catholics, New Agers', and Athiests.  Someone might think 
to change the name to:  soc.religion.any   - or -  perhaps even
soc.religion.new.  It might seem to be more appropriate.
Heck, don't flame me, I'm Catholic, gay, and I voted 
for Bill Clinton.  I'm on your side!

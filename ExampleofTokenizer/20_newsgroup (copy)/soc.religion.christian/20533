			========

	A seed is such a miraculous thing,
	It can sit on a shelf forever.
	But how it knows what to do, when it's stuck in the ground,
	Is what makes it so clever.
	It draws nutrients from the soil through it's roots,
	And gathers its force from the sun
	It puts forth a whole lot of blossoms and fruit,
	Then recedes itself when it is done.
	Who programmed the seed to know just what to do?
	And who put the sun in the sky?
	And who put the food in the dirt for the roots?
	And who told the bees to come by?
	And who makes the water to fall from above,
	To refresh and make everything pure?
	Perhaps all of this is a product of love,
	And perhaps it happened by chance.
				Yeah, sure.

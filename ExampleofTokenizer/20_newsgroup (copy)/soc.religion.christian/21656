Fred Gilham asks whether it is true that Goedel wrote a version of
the ontological argument for the existence of God.

Yes, it is true. Someone has published a rebuttal pointing out
certain flaws in the argument, and recently Professor C Anthony
Anderson, of the Philosophy Department of the University of
Minnesota, has written a revised version of the argument, perhaps
free of flaws, and at any rate free of the flaws complained of in
the original version. He has sent me a copy, which I still have (I
saw it last week when I was looking for something else), and when it
surfaces again I can supply particulars. My guess is that it is
being published (or already has been) in the Journal of Symbolic
Logic.

 Yours,
 James Kiefer

[4) "Nothing unclean shall enter [heaven]" (Rev. 21.27). Therefore,
babies are born in such a state that should they die, they are cuf off
from God and put in hell, which is exactly the doctrine of St. Augustine
and St. Thomas.  Of coures, having only original sins on thier souls,
they suffer the lightest punishment, the loss of the vision oand
presence of God, but that does not change the undeniable fact that they
cannot possibly come to a forgivenss of original sin, nor can they
inherit eternal life.  "That," as St. Augustine said, "Is what the
Pelagian heretics taught."  Which is why he said later, "If you want to
be a Christian, do not teach that unbaptized infants can come to a
forgivenss of original sin."]

Doesn't the Bible say that God is a fair god?  If this is true, how can this
possibly be fair to the infants?

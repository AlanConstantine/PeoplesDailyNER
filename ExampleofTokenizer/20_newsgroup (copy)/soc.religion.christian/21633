Although simplistic I have always liked the fact that "a Christian is one
who not only believes in God, but believes God."  After all the name was
first given externally to identify those who "preached Christ and Him
crucified" to pay the price of their rebeliion and shortcomings before
God.  God said this was His son -- I belive Him.

[It's certainly a good things for Christians to follow.  But as
a definition it may be a bit hard to apply.  --clh]

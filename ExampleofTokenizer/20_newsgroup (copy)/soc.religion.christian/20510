					Pardon me, a humble atheist, but exactly what is the difference
between holding a revealed truth with blind faith as its basis (i.e.
regardless of any evidence that you may find to the contrary) as an
absolute truth, fully expecting people to believe you and arrogance?

     They sound like one and the same to me.

     And nearly every time I meet a christian (or for that matter, any
other theist) who tries to convert me, I find this proven over and over
again.

     I see no wisdom whatsoever in your words


                                       Unfaithfully yours,

                                       Pixie


     p.s.  If you do sincerely believe that a god exists, why do you follow
it blindly?  

     Do the words "Question Authority" mean anything to you?

     I defy any theist to reply.

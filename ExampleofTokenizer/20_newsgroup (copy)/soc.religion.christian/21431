Gee, I think there are some real criminals (robbers, muderers, drug
addicts) who appear to be fun loving caring people too.  So what's
your point?  Is it OK. just because the people are nice?

I think the old saying " hate the sin and not the sinner" is
appropriate here.  Many who belive homosexuality is wrong probably
don't hate the people.  I don't.  I don't hate my kids when they do
wrong either.  But I tell them what is right, and if they lie or don't
admit they are wrong, or just don't make an effort to improve or
repent, they get punished.  I think this is quite appropriate.  You
may want to be careful about how you think satan is working here.
Maybe he is trying to destroy our sense of right and wrong through
feel goodism.  Maybe he is trying to convince you that you know more
than God.  Kind of like the Adam and Eve story.  Read it and compare
it to today's mentality.  You may be suprised.

I am going to stop reading the homosexuality posts, at least for a  
while, because of the repeated seemingly personal attacks on me via  
post/e-mail(mainly e-mail).  If anyone has a specific comment,  
suggestion, and/or note that does not contain any name calling, etc.  
that they would like for me to read, send it to me via e-mail.  I  
would like a copy of file mentioned by the moderator ragarding the  
exergetical issue of it.  I attempted to get it via ftp but was  
unable.

In Christ's Love,
Bryan

Greetings and Salutations!

I would like to get in touch with people who
(a) consider themselves Christians (you define it), and
(b) are in the Martial Arts

Some topics for discussion:
	- your particular martial art
	- your view of the relationship between
		Christianity and your art
	- your view of the relationship between
		*your* Christianity and your art
	- why should a Christian participate in MA
	- why shouldn't a Christian participate in MA
	- Biblical views of MA; pro or con.

For example, I heard from one fellow:
	"...I tried the Karate for Christ thing and it wasn't for me..."
	- why or why not?

As an aside, I am involved (in *NO* official way) with an
organization called the Christian Black Belt Association and
I would also like to distribute info regarding upcoming events
to *those who are interested*.  No, you won't be put on any
"mailing list" nor will your name be "sold".

However, if you ARE intested in an email list, let me know.

I am interested in email replies ONLY as this is cross-posted 
to groups I don't normally read.  If anyone wants a summary
or, of course, on-going discussion, then let me know.


Shalom,
Robert Switzer

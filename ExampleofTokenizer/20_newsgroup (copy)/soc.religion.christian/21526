I would not swear that nothing of the sort is found in the Iliad,
but the first passage I thought of was the Odyssey 11:480 or
thereabouts (my copy has no line numbers). The ghost of Acchilles
speaks (Robert FitzGerald translation):

The next passage I thought of was from Ecclesiastes 9:4

 + A living dog is better than a dead lion.

Surely Aristotle had little influence on Christian thought before
about 1250 AD.

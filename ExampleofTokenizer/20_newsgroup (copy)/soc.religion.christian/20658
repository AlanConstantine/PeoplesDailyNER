Sorry for bothering with a request almost irrelevant to anyone except for me:
Could some kind soul provide me with the phone number of
wycliffe center
horsley green high wycomb
bucks hp 14 3 xl
I want to surprise a friend of mine staying there, but I don't have the number.

thanks a lot in advance

Gerhard

[Obviously email response is best.  What do people think of requests
like this?  Unless things are very different in the UK and US, it should
be possible to find this out by calling what we call "information".
The netwide cost of a posting is fairly significant.  --clh]

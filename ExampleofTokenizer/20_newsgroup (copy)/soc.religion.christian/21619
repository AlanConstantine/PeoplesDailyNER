Yes, let do.  Try: 

"And if anyone causes one of these little ones *who believes in me*
to sin, it would be better for him to be thrown into the sea
with a large millstone tied around his neck."  Mark 9:42

"Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them,
for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.  I tell you
the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God
like a little child will never enter it."

The Colossians passage does not make faith a requirement
for baptism.  It merely says that in baptism we are born again,
regenerated, and resurrected through faith.  In the case
of an infant I would say that baptism works faith in the
heart of the infant--through the power of the word.

The Colossians passage does make baptism a spiritual circumcision.
Circumcision was the means by which a male infant was made
a part of God's covenant with Israel.  It was commanded to be
performed on the eighth day.  The early church understood this,
and even debated whether baptism had to be performed on the
eighth day, or if it could in fact be done earlier.

Aaron> Romans 10:16-17 "But not all the Israelites accepted the good
Aaron> news.  For Isaiah says, 'Lord, who has believed our message?'
Aaron> Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the
Aaron> message is heard through the word of Christ."

Aaron> So then we receive God's gift of faith to us as we hear the
Aaron> message of the gospel.  

And the gospel is surely preached at any infant's (or adult's)
baptism.  Indeed, in a very real sense, the sacraments are
the Gospel made tangible.

Aaron> Faith is a possible response to hearing
Aaron> God's word preached.  Kids are not yet spiritually,
Aaron> intellectually, or emotionally mature enough to respond to

How do you know they are not yet mature enough to have faith?
Do you know this on the basis of God's Word, or from your own
reason?

Faith is also described as a gift from God, Ephesians 2:8,9. 
He gives faith to infants just as he gives it to adults, through
the power of the gospel, Romans 1:6.

Aaron> If you read all of Ezekiel 18, you will see that God doesn't
Aaron> hold us guilty for anyone else's sins.  So we can have no
Aaron> original guilt from Adam.

Here you show that you just don't understand original sin--
you are arguing against a straw man.
Maybe you've been talking to Catholics too much.  I don't
know.  But original sin does not consist of God's imputation
of Adam's guilt to us.  It consists of our inheritance of
Adam's sinful nature.  It is actual sin.  See for example,
the Augsburg Confession, Article II, and the Apology of the
Augsburg Confession, Article II, and, for extra credit,
John Knox's `The Scots confession', Article III.

Aaron> Now then that we have a little more background as to why
Aaron> original sin is not Biblical, let's look at some of the
Aaron> scriptures used to support it.

Aaron> Romans 5:12 "Therefore, just as sin entered the world through

Aaron> all men, because all sinned--"


Ask yourself this question.  "Do infants ever die?"  Then ask
yourself, "If infant baptism is not valid, then where was the
Christian Church during all the centuries when almost all 
of the baptisms were performed on infants?  Were Luther, Melancthon,
Calvin, Zwingli, Hus, Knox, Andrae, and Chemnitz Christians?


Aaron> Psalm 51:5 "Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time
Aaron> my mother conceived me."

Aaron> This whole Psalm is a wonderful example of how we should humble

Who are you to say what is literal and what is not?  Is a literal
interpretation manifestly absurd in Psalm 51 by reason of direct
contradiction with a clear passage from the Word of God?

You might also compare Genesis 8:21, "The LORD smelled the
pleasing aroma and said in his heart, `Never again will I curse
the ground because of man, even though every inclination of
his heart is evil from childhood...."

Aaron> We see
Aaron> that he did grow and become wiser in Luke 2:40 and 2:52.  The
Aaron> implication is that Jesus did wrong things as a child before he
Aaron> knew to choose right over wrong.

You are a long way from proving this (rather monstrous) assertion.
All you can say is that Jesus grew in wisdom and in stature.  A
conclusion that he did wrong as a child is based on an extrapolation
of reason, not on a direct revelation in Scripture.

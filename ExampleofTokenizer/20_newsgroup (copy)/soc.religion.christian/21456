: You might want to re-think your attitude about the Holocaust after
: reading Deuteronomy chapter 28.

On the contrary, after the Holocaust, I would be _very_ cautious about my
interpretatoin of Deuteronomy 28.  Not everything that happens is in
accordance with God's will.  (You might guess which side of the
predestination issue I am on.)  I will never _assume_ that evil is 
punishment by God, especially when I am speaking of the evil that falls on
_someone else_.  For my own life, I will work to discern the hand of God
in the evil that befalls _me_.

See the discussion earlier on Luke 13.

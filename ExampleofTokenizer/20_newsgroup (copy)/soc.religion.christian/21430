Well, since my wife is (in your gentle term) a "bastard", I can
probably speak with a bit of authority on this. Any "stigma"
associated with children conceived and/or born out of wedlock rests
solely upon the parents--they've committed a sexual transgression for
which they should repent. The child itself has no a priori limitations
on him or her; indeed, the concept of blaming the child for the
parents' sins is one most Mormons would find appalling; note that LDS
theology rejects original sin, as the term is usually defined, and the
subsequent need for infant baptism (cf. Moroni 8 in the Book of
Mormon).  Indeed, LDS doctrine goes one step further and in some cases
holds parents responsible for their children's sins if they have
failed to bring them up properly (cf. D&C 68:25-28; note that this
passage applies it only to members of the LDS Church).

Also note that there is no "big genealogical book in Salt Lake City".
The LDS Church has a massive storage facility in the nearby mountains
containing (on microfilm) vital statistic records (birth, christening,
baptism, marriage, death) gathered from all over the entire world. I
may be misremembering, but I believe they have records for some 2
billion people in that vault. At the same time, the LDS Church is
building up an on-line genealogical database. In neither case is there
some kind of "worthiness screening" as to whether someone can be
entered in. The only potential issue is that of establishing who the
parents were, and that would apply only in the case of the database.

[The following arrived as a separate posting --clh]

A follow-up to my own follow-up--lest anyone misunderstand, the term
"bastard" is one which I have never in 25 years of LDS Church
membership heard applied, formally or informally, to a child born out
of wedlock, and indeed would (rightly) be considered a vulgar,
offensive term. I would not have echoed the expression in my reply,
except in hopes that the poster would recognize the offensive nature
of the word in the given context. Unfortunately, after posting my
reply, I remembered that subtle points are often lost on the 'net, and
figured I'd better spell it out.  ..bruce..

I'd recommend McDowell's "Evidence that Demands a Verdict" books (3 I
think) and  Manfred Brauch's "Hard Sayings of Paul".  He also may have
done "Hard Sayings of Jesus".  My focus would be for a new Christian to
struggle with his faith and be encouraged by the historical evidence,
especially one who comes from a background which emphasizes knowable faith.

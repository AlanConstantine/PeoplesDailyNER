	"And in that day you will ask Me no question.  Truly, truly, I say to 
	you, if you shall ask the Father for anything, He will give it to you 
	in my name.  Until now you have asked for nothing in My name; ask, and 
	you will receive, that your joy may be made full."
				-John 16:23-24

I don't believe that we necessarily have to say " . . . In Christ's name.  
Amen," for our prayers to be heard, but it glorifies the Son, when we 
acknowledge that our prayer is made possible by Him.  I believe that just as 
those who were saved in the OT, could only be saved because Jesus would one day
reconcile God to man, He is the only reason their prayers would be heard by 
God.

	For all of us have become like one who is unclean,
	And all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment;
	And all of us wither like a leaf,
	and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.
				-Isaiah 64:6, NAS

Our prayers like the rest of our deeds are too unholy to go directly to the
Father because they are tainted by our sin.  Only by washing these prayers with
Christ's blood are they worthy to be lifted to to the Father.

	"First, I thank my God through Christ Jesus . . ."
				-Romans 1:8, NAS

Some scholars believe that this is Paul recognizing that even his thanks are 
too unholy for the Father.
	Basically, prayer is a gift of grace, I believe that only through Jesus
do our prayers have any power; thus, praying in His name glorifies and praises 
Jesus for this beautiful and powerful gift He has given us.

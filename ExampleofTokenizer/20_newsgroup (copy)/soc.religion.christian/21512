Do we attach some meaning of the Israelites entering "the promised land" to 
Christianity?

   I submit God did not hold the children responsible when the adults chose 
to follow the bad report of the 10 spies over Joshua and Caleb.  This is 
recorded for us in Deuteronomy 1:39 "Moreover your little ones, which ye said 
should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge 
between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give 
it, and they shall possess it."

   At least to me it seems there was/is an age, or point in maturity where 
they were/are held responsible, and could not enter the "Promised Land", 
younger ones were not held to the same "rules", at least not by God.

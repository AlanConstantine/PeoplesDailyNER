As St. Augustine said, "I did not invent original sin, which the
Catholic faith holds from ancient time; but you, who deny it, without a
doubt are a follower of a new heresy."  (De nuptiis, lib. 11.c.12)]

Why is it fair to punish you, me and the rest of humanity because of
what Adam and Eve did? Suppose your parents committed some crime before
you were born and one day the cops come to your door and throw you in
jail for it. Would you really think that is fair? I know I wouldn't.

Phew! That takes a load off. I don't want to live forever.  I wish
most Christians held this view.  You can't walk across campus in
spring without being assailed by fire-and-brimstone preachers.  I
really think the metaphor should be limited, at least with respect to
teaching our children.  It's criminal to put these ideas into a young
and trusting mind.  Besides, why not rely on the positive aspects of
your religion to win their faith?

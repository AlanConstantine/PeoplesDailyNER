I would like to see his reasoning behind this.  You may have gotten 
"burned" by natural disaster prophecies down there, but that
does not mean that every natural disaster/judgement prophecy is
false.  Take a quick look at the book of Jeremiah and it is obvious
that judgement prophecies can be valid.  here in the US, it seems like
we might have more of a problem with positive prophecies, though I
am sure there may be a few people who are too into judgement.

Sometimes God does give words that are difficult to swallow.  The
relative positiveness of a prophecy is not necesarily grounds to
dismiss it.  Much of the OT is not happy stuff.

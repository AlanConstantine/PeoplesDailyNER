If we take things this literally then we must also forbid women from
speaking in church. Paul while led by the holy spirit was human and could
err. I find it interesting that CHRIST never discussed the issue of
homosexuality, certainly it existed back then and if it was a serious
transgression CHRIST would have condemned it. 
I find it disturbing that the modern church spends its energy trying
to stamp out something that CHRIST didn't consider worth a single word
of condemnation. CHRIST repeatedly warns us against judgement. 
Don't we risk "judgement in equal measure" when we condemn people who 
GOD himself did not judge when he walked on the earth?

[I should not that many of our readers do in fact advocate forbiding
women from speaking in church.  This is an issue we have discussed
in the past, and I'm not interested in redoing.  --clh]

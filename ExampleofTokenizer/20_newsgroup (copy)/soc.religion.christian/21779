After reading this story about St. Maria Goretti (posted two weeks
ago), I am a bit confused.  While it is clear that her daily
life is one of probity and sanctity, I am afraid I don't quite
understand the final episode of her life.  I am reading it 
correctly, she (and the Church apparently) felt that being raped
was a sin on _her_ part, one so perfidious that she would rather
die than commit it.  If this is the case I'm afraid that I 
disagree rather strongly.

Can anyone out there explain this one to me?

Yours in Christ,

David Cruz-Uribe, SFO

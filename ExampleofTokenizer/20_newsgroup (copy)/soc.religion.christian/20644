I agree.  God makes the husband the head of the house.  But he surely
can't do it alone.  He needs the help of his beloved wife whom the
Lord gave him.

At least that's how it is in my house.  I thank God for the beautiful
woman He has brought into my life.  I couldn't lead without the help
of my wonderful wife.

One of the Laws of Nature, specifying cause and effect seems to dictate 
(at least to this layman's mind) there must be a causal event.  No
reasonable alternative exists.

As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a "why".  That isn't
true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural).

I believe the "genetic code" will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes,
but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining, 
reproducing life, *ever*.  (I've never been much of a prophet, though. I
can't even *picture* New York in my mind 8^] ).  I don't believe *any*
technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life, despite
having all of the parts available. Just my opinion.

That preposition sort of precludes an absolute, doesn't it?  Without an 
absolute conclusion, what are we left with?  I believe the word "faith"
works nicely.

Well then, with an *equal* scale, and under an *equal* standard, investigate
them all, and discover where God is ( or *whether* he is, for the denial of
God is ultimately a statement of faith, non-falsifiable as His existence 
may be). 

For isn't this the purpose of religion - to discover, and in discovery, to
*know* God?

You don't mind if a few of us send up a prayer on your behalf during your
research, do you?  After all, if we of Christ are deluding ourselves, you
really have nothing to worry about, eh?

Until the King returns,

Jason

   I apologize if this post isn't entirely appropriate for the newsgroup.

   I would like to correspond with any Christians attending the University
of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  I will be transfering there in August to
complete my Ph.D. and I thought it would be nice to correspond with people
before I moved out.

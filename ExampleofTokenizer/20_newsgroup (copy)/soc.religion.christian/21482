I haven't read this entire thread, but, if someone hasn't tossed this out yet, then here it is: 

2 Samuel 12:21-23 (RSV) : 

  "Then his servants said to him, `What is this thing that you have
  done? You fasted and wept for the child while it was alive; but when
  the child died, you arose and ate food.' He [David] said, 'While the
  child was still alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, 'Who knows
  whether the LORD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?' But
  now he is dead; why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall
  go to him, but he will not return to me.'"

Anyhow, many interpret this to mean that the child has gone to Heaven
(where David will someday go). I don't claim to know for sure if this
applies to all babies or not. But even if it's just this one, what
would you say to this?

I'd suggest that more than _some_ qualms are in order.  Without knowing
anything about the situation, it is impossible to evaluate the
appropriateness of writing.  Some folks will check, others with more
zeal than time may not.

IMHO, requests of this nature should be made only for oneself or for someone
who knows and approves of the idea.  Otherwise, it is intrusive and
disrespectful of the individual.

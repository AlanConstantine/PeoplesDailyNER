(Dear Moderator: Would you add this to the BCC faq?)

In case there are any ex-members of the "Boston Church of Christ"
looking for a support organization, here's the number of "BostonEX" in
Burlington, MA: 617-272-1955.

--------

s.r.c readers in New England may be interested in seeing a series of
news reports about the BCC in the 6 pm nightly news on Channel 5
(WCVB, Boston), for the next few days (starting Wed, 5/19).

For viewers outside the Boston area, the same telecasts will also be
aired on the "New England Cable News" channel at 8 pm.

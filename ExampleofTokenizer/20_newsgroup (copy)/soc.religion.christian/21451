There is a BIG difference between the status of what you refer to as
Alexandrians (actually, this includes all Oriental Orthodox Churches
and not only Copts) and that of Nestorians. The Oriental Orthodox
Churches never even "shelter" Eutyches (the advocator of Monophysitism)
but on the contrary, it condemned (and still does condemn) him and his
heresy. That is why the Eastren (Chalcedonian) Orthodox Church held
talks with the Oriental (non-Chalcedonian) that started 30 years ago
and still continueing till today, but they have converged on many
issues the most imporatant of which is Christology (I have more 
details of the inter-Orthodox dialogue, in case anyone is interested).
So I do not see how the "Alexandrians" and the Nestorians are in a
similar position.

Peace,

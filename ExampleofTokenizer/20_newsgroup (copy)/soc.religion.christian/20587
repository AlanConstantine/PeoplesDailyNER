If you would bother to check in any good dictioanry or thesaurus, I think
you will find that "arrogance" has to do with an offensive exhibition of
presumed or real superiority (a paraphrase from my own Webster's).
Arrognace is about pride and haughtiness. A person can believe in absolute
truth, even blindly (whatever that means) without being obnoxious about it.
Just as a person can be a "humble," authority-questioning,
defying-any-theist-to-reply athiest and be quite arrogant. Arrogance is not
about what you believe, it is about how you relate to what you believe and
how you present it to others. If your overwhelming experience of Christians
has been that they are arrogant, I apologozing both for myself and on the
behalf of those who have offfended you. But my own experience, at least in
forums like Usenet where you see a good mix of people, is that arrogant
Christians and athiests seems to occur in about equal numbers.

Hey, we're talking about the PHONE COMPANY, here. The Phone Company doesn't
have opinions on this kind of stuff. This is all me.

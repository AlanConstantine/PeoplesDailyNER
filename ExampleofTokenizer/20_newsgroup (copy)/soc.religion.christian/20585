Must there be a "why" to this?  I ask because of what you also
     assume about God-- namely, that He just exists, with no "why"
     to His existence.  So the question is reversed, "Why can't
     we assume the universe just exists as you assume God to
     "just exist"?  Why must there be a "why" to the universe?"

It may be that one day man not only can create life but can also
     create man.  Now, I don't see this happening in my lifetime,
     nor do I assert it is probable.  But the possibility is there,
     given scientists are working hard at "decoding" out "genetic
     code" to perhaps help cure disease of a genetic variation.
     Again, though, must there be "why" or a "divine prupose" to
     man's existence?

As far as we can tell, man falls into the "mammal" catagory.  Now,
     if there were something more to the man (say, a soul), then
     we have yet to find evidence of such.  But as it is now, man
     is a mammal (babies are born live, mother gives milk, we're
     warm-blooded, etc.) as other mammals are and is similar in
     genetic construction to some of them (in particular, primates).
     For more on this check out talk.origins.

Well, then, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Hinduism, Judaism,
     Zoerasterism, Shintoism, and Islam should fit this bit of logic
     quite nicely... :-)  All have depth, all have enduring values,
     thus all must be true...

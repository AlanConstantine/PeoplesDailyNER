Interesting point.  The Bible doesn't say "hate the sin".
It tells to avoid sin, resist sin, even, when necessary, denounce sin.
But not hate.

[The following passages all talk about God or people God approves of
hating sin or some other action.  Ps 119:113 also talks about hating
the sinner.  I believe there are other passages that would talk about
hating someone who is evil, but I didn't turn them up in this search
(which was on the word "hate" in the KJV, though I've crosschecked
each passage in the NRSV).

Ps 97:10, 101:3, 105:25, 119:104, 113, 128, 163, , 139:21-22
Prov 6:16, 8:13
Isa 61:8
Amos 5:15
Zec 8:17
Rev 2:6

          and philosophical traditions as they relate to Ahmadiyya 
          Muslim Community.

    ii)   To discuss the doctrines, origin and teachings the Ahmad-
          iyya Muslim Community, a dynamic world-wide movement.

    iii)  To expound Islamic teachings and beliefs in the Holy 
          Quran and Islamic traditions from the Ahmadiyya Islamic
          perspective.

    iv)   To emphasize and discuss the similarities between Ahmadi 
          Muslims and followers of other religions of the world and 
          to explore how understanding and respect for each other's
          faith can be brought about to eliminate religious intol-
          erance and malice among people of all religious and phil-
          osophical traditions.
          
    v)    To look into the origin and teachings of all religions in
          general and of Islam and Ahmadiyya Muslim Movement in par-
          ticular, and to use the commonality of origin to foster
          better understanding among Ahmadi Muslims and other people
          and to promote an acceptance of universality of fundamental
          rights to the freedom of conscience.

    vi)   To point out current world problems and suggest solutions 
          to these problems, as offered by different religions and 
          systems of ethical philosophies.

    vii)  To investigate the implications of science on religion 
          with particular emphasis on the Ahmadi Muslim perspective,
          but with openness to dialogue with people of all religions
          and philosophical traditions with reasoned positions as to
          the relationship between religion and empirical science,
          logic, and scientific ethics. 
          
    viii) To exchange important news and views about the Ahmadiyya
          Muslim Community and of other religions.

    ix)   To add diversity to the existing religious newsgroups pre-  
          sent on Usenet in the interest of promoting a forum for
          decorous dialogue. 

    x)    To inquire why religious persecution is on the rise in the
          world and suggest solutions to remedy the ever deterior-
          ating situation in the world in general and in the Islamic
          world in particular. 

    xi)   To commemorate the contributions to humanity, society and
          world peace made by the founders and followers of all
          religions in general and by the International Ahmadiyya
          Muslim community in particular.


TYPE: 
====

The group will be MODERATED for orderly and free religious dialo-
gue. The moderation will NOT prevent disagreement, dissent, or 
controversy based on a difference of beliefs or doctrine; rather,
the moderators will seek mainly to discourage gratuitously deroga-
tory, abusive, or squalid language, and the introduction of issues
which are irrelevant based on the provisions of this charter. 

The moderators have been chosen through personal e-mail and through
a general consensus among the proponents by discussion in news.groups.
The following moderators have been proposed and agreed upon:

Moderator:     Nabeel A. Rana  <rana@rintintin.colorado.edu>
Co-Moderator:  Dr. Tahir Ijaz  <ijaz@ccu.umanitoba.ca>



A  BRIEF  DESCRIPTION  ABOUT  AHMADIYYA  ISLAM:
===============================================


        The Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam, an international organi-
sation, was found in 1889 in Qadian, India. The founder of this
movement, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), was proclaimed to 
be the Promised Reformer of this age as foretold in the Scriptures
of almost all major religions of the world. He claimed to be the 
fulfillment of the long awaited second comming of Jesus Christ
(metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised Messiah.

        The claims of Hazrat Ahmad raised storms of hostility and
extreme opposition, which are often witnessed in the history of 
divine reformers. Even today this sect is being persecuted especial-
ly in some of the Muslim regimes. The right of Ahmadi Muslims to 
openly practice their religion and to define themselves as Muslims
has been severely restricted in many Muslim Countries. The United
Nations, human rights organizations such as Amnesty International
and top leaderships of some countries have voiced their concerns 
against this denial of basic human and civil liberaties to the
members of this movement, but so far to no avail.

        Despite the opposition and persecution, the movement cont-
inues to grow with a current membership of millions from around the
world in over 130 countries, who come from diverse ethnic and cul-
tural backgrounds.

        The movement is devoted to world peace and strives towards
developing a better understanding of all religions. Ahmadi Muslims
have always been opposed to all forms of violence, bigotry, reli-
gious intolerance and fundamentalism.

        Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-
tablished a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clinics
in many third world countries. These institutions are staffed by
volunteer professionals and are fully financed by the movement's
internal resources. The movement stresses the importance of educa-
tion and leadership. Its members have included a high number of
professionals as well as world class individuals.

        The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral
reform, establish peace and justice, and to unite mankind under
one universal brotherhood.


NEWSGROUP CREATION: 
==================

        The  discussion for this proposed newsgroup has now offi-
cially ended. Voting will be held for three weeks. If the news-
group gets 2/3rd majority AND 100 more "YES/Create" votes than

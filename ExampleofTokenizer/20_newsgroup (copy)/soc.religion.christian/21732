  This neatly eliminates the need for a savior and "proves" that we can be
saved by works alone!  If we have no original sin, then it is possible for
us to save ourselves by not sinning.  I understand the reasoning behind your
argument, but it leads to sheer folly.  Original sin is the reason we need
faith to be saved.

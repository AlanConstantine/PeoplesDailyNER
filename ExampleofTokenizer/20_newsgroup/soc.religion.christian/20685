One can feel physical pain by having a body, which, if you know the
doctrine of the resurrection of the body, is what people will have after
the great judgement.  "We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the
life of the world to come."  - Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed.  You
will have both body and soul in hell - eventually.

The phrase is "eulogemene su en gunaixin"- "blessed are you among women."
There is nothing to indicate that this is an exceptional or unique status,
only that _as a woman_ Mary was blessed.  Adding the word "all" is not
a fair reading of the text.  There are some good reasons for the church's
veneration of Mary, but they cannot depend on this verse.

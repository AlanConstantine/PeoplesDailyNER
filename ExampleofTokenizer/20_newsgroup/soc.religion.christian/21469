If that's the ONLY reason, I'd be inclined to doubt whether or not what
they profess is Christianity.  The relationship of faith is based upon
trust.  Fear and trust are generally incompatible.  If my only motivation
is fear, is there room for trust?  If so, there's room for faith.  
If fear precludes trust, then there can't be faith.

I have a hard time understanding this attitude.

If the gospels are the least bit accurate, then there can be little
doubt that Jesus belived hell was a reality.

As a teacher, what would be the wise and loving thing to do if people
in your audience were headed there?  To warn them!  It would, however, 
be rather cruel and/or sadistic to believe that such a place exists 
and then remain quiet about it.  

The only scenario I can envision in which dimished respect would be
justified is if Jesus knew there was no such place as hell, and spoke
about it anyway, just to scare people. Unless you would accuse Jesus
of this, I would encourage you to reconsider what a loving response 
is when you perceive someone to be in danger.

I think it was Lewis who said that in a wedding, it's the principals  
that marry each other; the church and the state are present merely as  
witnesses.

[This is not just Lewis -- it's a summary of standard Catholic
theology.  However this doesn't mean that the presence of those
witnesses is optional, except in odd situations like the standard
desert island.  --clh]

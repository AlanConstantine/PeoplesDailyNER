This was a popular belief in the Judaism of Jesus` time, that Elijah
would return again (as he had been taken in to heaven in a chariot and
did not actually die).  However Jesus was referring to John the
Baptist not in the sense that Elijah was reincarnated as John
(remember Elijah didn`t die) but that John was a similar prophet to
Elijah.  John was a fiery preacher, he wore sackcloth and wandered
rough through Israel preaching the coming kingdom.  The verses that
describe him (in Mark`s gospel) can be linked to OT references about
Elijah.  Hence John was similar to Elijah and Jesus was drawing the
parallels between the two just as he drew parallels with the Suffering
Servant in Isaiah (and other messianic figures) and himself.

A brief reply but I don`t have time to look up all the relevant stuff.

Suffice to say there is a very strong explanation.



Rick.

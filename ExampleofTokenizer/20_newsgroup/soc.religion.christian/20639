Regarding the moral question Jen (jenk@microsoft.com) asked: "Is it
okay to create a child if you aren't able to be a good parent?", I
am reminded of a "speech" by one of the characters (I can't remember
which) in the movie "Parenthood". [I am WAY to liberal with my
quotation marks tonight...]

In this so-called (by me) speech, the character is expressing what 
a lousy father he had and he made an interesting point.  He said
something to the effect of:
"You have to have a license to drive a car.  You have to have a
license to own a dog.  You even have to have a license to fish.
But, they'll anyone have a kid." [Keep in mind that I am, in NO
way, trying to pass this off as a quote.  It is probably GROSSLY
distorted but I think you get the point...]

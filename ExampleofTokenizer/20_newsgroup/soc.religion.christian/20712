I'm waiting for an RC to speak up ! 8-)
Nobody has, so I will...

Those with Bibles on hand can give the exact chapter & verse...
At the time Jesus told Peter that he was the "rock", He said
whatever you hold true on earth is held true in heaven, and 
whatever you don't hold true won't be true in heaven.

Therefore, with respect to marriage, the ceremony has to be
done by an RC priest. No big parties required. Just the priest,
the couple and witnesses. "Divorce" is not allowed. But anullments
are granted upon approval by either the bishop or the Pope 
(not sure if the Pope delegates this function).

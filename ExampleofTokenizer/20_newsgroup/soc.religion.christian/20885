Cloak yourself in God's sustaining and abiding love. Pray, pray, pray.
Pray for your brother, that he will assume the Godly role that is his.
Pray for your sister-in-law, the what ever is driving her to separate
your brother and herself from the the rest of the family will be healed.
Pray for God to give you the peace in the knowledge that you may not be
able to 'fix' it. From your description it would appear that it will
require devine intervention, and the realization by your brother as to
what his responsibilities are. Seek Godly counsel from your pastor, or
other spiritually mature believer. Know always that He is akways there
as a conforter, and will give you wisdon and direction as you call on
Him.

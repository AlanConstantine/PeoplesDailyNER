On the basis of these examples I would say that Joe Moore was only wrong
in claiming Augustine as a prime mover of the sin=sex view.  These quotes
clearly equate sexuality with defilement and incontinance, even within
the marriage relationship (else they would not apply to Mary after her marriage
to Joseph).

So Joe's assignment of the reasoning behind the concept of the perpetual
virginity of Mary does seem to be supported by these quotes.

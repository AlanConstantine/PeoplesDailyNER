Ah, double-fulfillment.  First of all I would say that I'm not sure all
the prophecies had double-fulfillment, e.g., the Isaiah 7:14 prophecy.

I would say that just because this happens on some occasions does not mean
it will occur always, especially with regard to NT prophecies. The apostles
who quoted the OT and applied those passages to Jesus were acting as divine
messengers and giving the inerrant Word of God to the Church.  No one has
that authority today.  No one has the apostolic authority to say that
such-and-such a prophecy has double-fulfillment.  If the imagry of
Revelation fits with events of the 1st century, it is folly for us to try
and make it apply to events 20 centuries later.

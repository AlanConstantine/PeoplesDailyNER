The following is a juxtaposition of part of an ancient text known as
"de Sacramentis", usually attributed to St. Ambrose of Milan, and the
canon of the traditional Catholic Mass of the Roman rite.  The
conclusion from this comparison is that the central part of the
traditional Roman canon was already fairly well in place by sometime
in the late 4th century.

Taken from "The Mass of the Western Rites", by the Right Reverend Dom
Fernand Cabrol, Abbot of Farnborough, 1934, without permission.
Excerpted from Chapter VI: THE MASS AT ROME, FROM THE FIFTH TO THE
SEVENTH CENTURIES.  The paragraph at the end is from the book, not me.

Sorry about the long lines.

There is no doubt that we have here two editions of the same
text; and as that of De Sacramentis is localised in Upper Italy
and dated about the year 400, it is the most ancient witness we
possess as to the principal parts of the Roman canon, which only
appear in the Sacramentaries some time after the seventh
century. The question as to whether the Roman canon is not older
even than that of De Sacramentis is discussed by
liturgiologists.  Mgr. Batiffol is of this opinion, but we, on
the contrary, think that the former bears traces of closer
composition, of a more carefully guarded orthodoxy, and that
consequently it is a text corrected from De Sacramentis. We
shall see, in studying the list of names in the Memento of the
living and that of the dead, that Mgr. Batiffol argues with good
reason that he can date these fragments from the pontificate of
Symmachus (498-514). We thus have the state of the Roman Mass,
or at least of the chief parts of the canon, at the beginning of
the fourth century.

	The quick answer:  Revelation 12:7-9

	"And there was war in heaven.  Michael and his angels fought against
	the dragon and his angels who fought back.  But he [the dragon] was
	not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven.  The great
	dragon was hurled down--that ancient serpent, called the devil and
	Satan, who leads the whole world astray.  He was hurled down to the
	earth, and his angels with him."

	The earlier part of chapter 12 deals (very symbolically) with why
	Satan rose up in battle against Michael and the good angels in the
	first place.

	Hope this clears it up.

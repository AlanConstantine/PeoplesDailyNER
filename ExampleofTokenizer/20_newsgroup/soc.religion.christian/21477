I don't necessarily object to the secrecy but I do question it, since I see no 
Biblical reason why any aspect of Christian worship should involve secrecy.  
But I am interested in your claim that early Christian practices "parallel" 
Mormon temple ceremonies.  Could you give an example?  Also, why do they only 
parallel Mormon ceremonies?  Why don't Mormon ceremonies restore the original 
Christian practices?  Wasn't that the whole point of Joseph Smith's stated 
mission?

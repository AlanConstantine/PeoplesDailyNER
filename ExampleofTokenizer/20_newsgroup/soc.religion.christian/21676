The biblical arguments against homosexuality are weak at best, yet
Christ is quite clear about our obligations to the poor. How as 
Christians can we demand celibacy from homosexuals when we walk
by homeless people and ignore the pleas for help? 
Christ is quite clear on our obligations to the poor.

Thought for the day:

MAT 7:3 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but
considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Or how wilt thou say to
thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam
is in thine own eye?

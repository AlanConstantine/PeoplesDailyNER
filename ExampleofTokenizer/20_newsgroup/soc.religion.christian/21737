What is fornication? (sex outside of marriage, abuse of sex)  

Is not homosexual intercourse outside the context of marriage?
Isn't it an unatural use of what God has given us?

Why is it that homosexuals are using the Grace of God as a license to
practice sin? 

   For certain persons have crept in unnoticed, those who were long
   beforehand marked out for this condemnation, ungodly persons who
   turn the grace of our God into licentiousness and deny our only 
   Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.

                                      Jude 4 (NASB)

What is defined by God as a legitimate marriage?

   For this cause a man shall leave his father and his mother, and
   shall cleave to his wife; and the shall become one flesh.

                                      Gen 2:24 (NASB)

   And He answer and said, "Have you not read, that He who created them
   from the beginning MADE THEM MALE AND FEMALE, and said, 'FOR THIS 
   CAUSE A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER, AND CLEAVE TO HIS WIFE;
   AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH'?  Consequently they are no longer
   two, but one flesh.  What therefore God has joined together, let no
   man separate." 

                                      Matt 19:4-6 (NASB)

   But because of immoralities, let each man have his own wife, and let
   each woman have her own husband.  Let the husband fulfill his duty
   to his wife, and likewise also the wife to her husband.

                                      1 Corinthians 7:4,5 (NASB)

I disagree... Every law that is written in Leviticus should be looked at 
as sin.  That is why we have a need for a savior.  I can understand 
someone who may not know a particular sin listed in the Levitcal law, but
I would hope that they would repent when confronted with it.

Also I noticed that the preceeding verses say.  

   Also you shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness during her
   menstrual impurity.  And you shall not have intercourse with your
   neighbors wife, to be defiled with her. 


                                   Leviticus 18:19, 20 (NASB)

These verses are just as relevant as:

   You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an
   abomination.

                                   Leviticus 18:22 (NASB)

Why was God telling the Israelites not to practice such things?

   Do not defile yourselves by any of these things; for by all these
   the nations which I am casting out before you have become defiled.
   For the land has become defiled, therefore I have visited its 
   punishment upon it, so the land has spewed out its inhabitants.
   But as for you, you are to keep My statutes and Judgments, and 
   shall not do any of these abominations, neither the native, nor
   the alien who sojourns among you

                                    Leviticus 18:24-26 (NASB)

He is the Lord...  Listen to what he has to say... 

Nobody wants to dismiss homosexuals.  We do love you, but we don't 
agree that what you practice is not sin.  You have not truly repented
of your sin.  We hate the sin that is within your lives.  I hate sin
that is in my life.  All Christians should hate the sin that is within
their own lives.  Confrontaion with sin should bring about repentance. 
Yes I agree with John 3:17, but I also know that Jesus said, "Repent for
the kingdom of heaven is at hand"  Matt 3:17.  If you don't agree that
homosexuality is sin than how can you repent from it?  This means that
you remain in bondage to it.  Repent from it and God will set you free.

In His Love, 

       Mike

According to the legal practices of today's America, I imagine the legal
definition of religion, if defined, may resemble the following:

	"Any system of belief or practice to which people are committed
	for the benefit of society which must, in the opinion of secular
	thought, be isolated from political and educational influence."

	"Should any system of belief or practice to which people are
	committed be harmful or void of any benefit to society in the
	opinion of religious thought as defined in the previous paragraph,
	isolation of such from political and educational influence would
	constitute unreasonable censorship and an unlawful violation of
	civil rights."

Someday, perhaps they'll legalize benevolence :-)

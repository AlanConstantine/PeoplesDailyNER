It's like refusing 'God's kingdom come'.

In one of Jesus' revelation in this century, "...same thing as in
the old days.  People refuse to believe my messengers.  Even when
I was alive here on earth, they refuse Me.  What more when I am just
talking through somebody else?" (paraphrased).

With all the knowledge believers accumulated, He would think that
we would be 'enlightened' enough to detect which ones are 
'authentic and divine' as opposed to 'evil or man-made'.

These signs, these miracles, are you afraid that they are not from God?
That these are the signs we should not open our hearts and mind to for thinking
  they are evil?
Well, is faith in God evil?
Is true peace evil?  Is true love that is divine and pure evil? 
Why can't someone accept that God can do what He wants in fulfillment of His
  generous love and Jesus' never ending forgiveness to those who turn back to
  Him for salvation?
Why are we refusing God's messenger of this truth?  The mother to all who are
  in Christ?
What brings us these:
    fears of being shamed by what others will think or say about us?
        which, in contrary, could be pleasing to God?
    fears of being humbled?
    fears of being judged as wrong (wrt mainstream standard of what is right)?
Why can't we tolerate non-believers' mockery or ridicule of us for the
  sake of peace, love and obedience to God?  The humbling lessons left to us
  by martyrs and saints?
We'd rather engage in never-ending bickering and disproof of each other's
  opinion - looking at each other's mistakes - for the sake of arguments,
  instead of having communion in one body with Christ.
What makes us go blind to the truth that God is All Powerful and that He can
  not be binded by what people wrote and have written about Him in all ages?
Why is our faith in God limited?  By all the words and literature we muster?
What prevents us from going *beyond* being saved and extend God's rich love
  to others who are not?

Why are our eyes not wide open to see that He continuously sees our faith, hope
  and love which glorify Him and so He gives us indications of His 
  acknowledgements with signs/miracles (ordinary/common or divinely inspired) 
  everywhere?  Isn't that like an atheist/agnostic's view that all these
  are just ordinary here on earth and not caused by anything supernatural?

Why then does the Holy Mother comes back to remind us:
  "We must really __accept that prayer__ changes the course of things and that
  with prayers __even wars can be prevented__."
but then she continues:
  "You often have an egotistic attitude.  Dear children, in these days you
  have prayed very much, __but your hands have remained empty__."
Why hesitate in proclaiming what needs to be done:
  "prayer, conversion, peace, penance, fasting, the Holy Mass, living life
  as what the Gospel brings."?
Why not do so?  How?  To the world?
To this, the Mother says:
  "Start in your family.  Be a good example.  Live the Word."
Why worry if it is going to be of good use to many?
Our Holy Mother says:
  "The fruits, __leave them to the Lord__, do not worry about anything or 
  anyone but entrust yourself to the Lord."

Although the Holy Mother does not insist because:
  "You are free; I bow before the freedom which God gives you."
but she follows this with:
  "You are surprised because I say to you: Decide for God and yet, see how
  you have lived this day."
Why does she constantly conveys:
  "Take this life toward God in the way as to __experience__ the Lord Himself
  in your __behavior__ and __not only__ when you pray" or one time when we 
  decide that we are saved, or talk/write about God, etc.
The Holy Mother warns:
  "Satan (the serpent) is always trying to dissuade you to turn you away from
  my peace plan and prayer."  (Rev 12:17, the dragon became angry with the woman
  and went off to wage war against the rest of her offsprings, those who keep
  God's commandments, and bear witness to Jesus.)

Do you have fear or hate for God's current messenger of true peace, love and
  our motherly protector from the anti-Christ?
The one who is being apprehensive of communism, wars, famine and other evils
  that the serpent brings upon us? 
This obedient and blessed new Eve?
The mother who warns us so we can be prepared and be strong against Satan?
Haven't there been renewed faith, hope, love, peace and obedience wherever
  this messenger has shared her blessings and graces that God has given her
  in good purpose?
Why do we choose to be blind?
Why fear the truth that God has been giving us a chance and sharing Christ's
  ever-forgetting forgiveness to us through the obedient mother?
The mother who has been consecrated the task __to reverse__ the disobedient
  harm and example done by the ancient Eve.
She has been preparing the new Eden with her Immaculate Heart.
The new Eden as sanctuary (the womb) for the next coming and judgement of the 
  righteous by our Lord, Jesus Christ; when The Lamb marries His bride.
Shouldn't we give her a hand in her exhaustive job of preparing us for the
  second coming of her Son as she has been conceived without sin to bear
  the Son of God in her womb?
Why fear true peace, love and renewed faith and obedience to God that Mary
  faithfully brings to God's children?  She has been protecting the flock
  (the rest of the offsprings) from the greedy dragon so as to present more 
  righteous members for her Son's coming.
Not all apparitions and miracles that resulted from them are worthy
  of belief.  With prayer and guidance from the Holy Spirit and, of course,
  approval of our Church authorities, we should be aware of the true and
  divinely inspired ones; specifically, the ones which aligns with the
  Scripture.
  

Also, our Lady reminds us of recommendation of __silence__ in our prayers:
  "If you speak unceasingly in your prayers, how will you be able to hear
  God?  Allow Him room to answer you, to speak to you." 

She encourages us (with motherly nurturing) to continue in exuberant 
faith, hope and love to Jesus, constantly.  NOT with mere emotions, 
but with deep, constant obedience to Jesus, her Beloved Son and
acknowledgement of our need to have Him as part of our lives.

Let's not wait to the last minute to renew our faith and the life
that God wants us to live; when there won't be enough time or when
it will be late.
                                                      
Nowadays, Mary says, 
"Pray, pray, pray for peace...reconciliation, my children."
Have peace within yourself first before you can promote peace to
others.  For without peace, you can not fully accept my Son."
                                                                       

And you think she's just an ordinary lady.  Not to me.  She's
our good Mother/messenger from God and she is so nice enough to
share God's kingdom to us through her Son and experience it.

With Mary, we are assured that The Lamb always succeeds.

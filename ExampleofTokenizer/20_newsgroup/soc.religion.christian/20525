* The WITNESS Of The LORD JESUS CHRIST:

Mark 8:31 And He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer
     many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests
     and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.
                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Mark 9:31 For He was teaching His disciples and telling them, "The Son
     of Man is to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will
     kill Him; and when He has been killed, He will rise three days
     later."                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     ^^^^^
Mark 10:34 "And they will mock Him and spit upon Him, and scourge Him,
     and kill Him, and three days later He will rise again."
                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Mark 12:26 "But regarding the fact that the dead rise again, have you
     not read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the burning
     bush, how God spoke to him, saying, 'I am the God of Abraham, and
     the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'?

Luke 18:33 and after they have scourged Him, they will kill Him; and
     the third day He will rise again. "
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Luke 24:46 and He said to them, "Thus it is written, that the Christ
     should suffer and rise again from the dead the third day;^^^^^^
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
John 11:25 Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life; he
     who believes in Me shall live even if he dies,

John 20:9 For as yet they did not understand the Scripture, that He
     must rise again from the dead.                              ^^
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Acts 17:3 ...explaining and giving evidence that the Christ had to
     suffer and rise again from the dead, and saying, "This Jesus whom
     I am proclaiming to you is the Christ."

* The WITNESS Of The APOSTLE PAUL:  1 Corinthians 15:1-26

 1 Now I make known to you, brethren, the gospel which I preached to
   you, which also you received, in which also you stand,

 2 by which also you are saved, if you hold fast the word which I
   preached to you, unless you believed in vain.

 3 For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received,
   that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,

 4 and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day
   according to the Scriptures,     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 5 and that He appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.

 6 After that He appeared to more than five hundred brethren at one
   time, most of whom remain until now, but some have fallen asleep;

 7 then He appeared to James, then to all the apostles;

 8 and last of all, as it were to one untimely born, He appeared to me
   also.

 9 For I am the least of the apostles, who am not fit to be called an
   apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.

10 But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me did
   not prove vain; but I labored even more than all of them, yet not I,
   but the grace of God with me.

11 Whether then it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.

12 Now if Christ is preached, that He has been raised from the dead,
   how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?

13 But if there is no resurrection of the dead, not even Christ has
   been raised;

14 and if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is vain, your
   faith also is vain.

15 Moreover we are even found to be false witnesses of God, because we
   witnessed against God that He raised Christ, whom He did not raise,
   if in fact the dead are not raised.

16 For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised;

17 and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless; you are
   still in your sins.

18 Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.

19 If we have hoped in Christ in this life only, we are of all men most
   to be pitied.

20 BUT NOW CHRIST HAS BEEN RAISED FROM THE DEAD, the first fruits of
   those who are asleep.

21 For since by a man came death, by a man also came the resurrection
   of the dead.

22 For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive.

23 But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, after that those
   who are Christ's at His coming,

24 then comes the end, when He delivers up the kingdom to the God and
   Father, when He has abolished all rule and all authority and power.

25 For He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet.

26 The last enemy that will be abolished is death.


             LOGICAL PROOFS OF JESUS CHRIST'S RESURRECTION

            1.  Jesus's enemies *would not* have stolen His
                body because that would have perpetrated the
                resurrection--the very opposite of what they
                desired.

            2.  Jesus' disciples *could not* have stolen His
                body because Pontius Pilate established guards
                to stand watch over the tomb lest His body be
                stolen.

            3.  Sadly (and ironically), many of Jesus' disciples
                did not believe in the Resurrection until Jesus
                had risen from the dead.

            4.  In nearly 20 centuries, no body has ever been
                produced to refute Jesus' assertion that He
                *would indeed* rise from the dead.

            5.  The probability of being able to perpetrate such
                a hoax successfully upon the entire world for
                nearly 20 centuries is astronomically negative!

and or affects modern music.  This brief questionaire is summary of
the questions I would like answered.  A response is requested and

1.) How do you feel about groups like Diecide, Slayer, and Dio who
freely admit to practicing satanism and preach it in their songs?


2.) How do you feel about groups like Petra, old Stryper, Whitecross,
and Holy Soldier who promote and sing about Cristianity?


3.) How do you feel about groups like Front 242, XTC, Revolting Cocks,
Minor Threat, and Ministry who condone and sing about atheism?


4.) How do you feel about bands like Shelter who preach the Hare
Krishna religion and other minority(but not unheard of) religions?


5.a) Do you feel there is any difference between promoting music that
supports Cristianity and music that condones satanism?

  b) Why do you feel this way?


6.) What types of music do you listen to?


7.a) How often do you purchase music?

  b) How often does that music contain lyrics with undertones in
religion?


8.a) Do you feel that music one listens to affects the way one views
a particular religion? Religion in general?

  b) How does it affect the way you view your religion? All religions?


9.)  FEEL FREE TO ADD ANY COMMENTS HERE

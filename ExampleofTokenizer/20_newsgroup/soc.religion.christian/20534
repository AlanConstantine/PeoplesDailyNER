First of all, the original poster misquoted.  The reference is from 2 Tim 3:16.
The author was Paul, and his revelations were anything but "(at best) 
second-hand".

	"And is came about that as [Saul] journeyed, he was approaching
	 Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him; and
	 he fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul,
	 why are you persecuting Me?"  And he said, "Who art Thou, Lord?"  And
	 He said, "I am Jesus whom you are persecuting, . . ."
		(Acts 9:3-5, NAS)

Paul received revelation directly from the risen Jesus!  (Pretty cool, eh?)  He
became closely involved with the early church, the leaders of which were 
followers of Jesus throughout his ministry on earth.

I agree.  I don't believe anyone but the Spirit would be able to convince you 
the Spirit exists.  Please don't complain about this being circular.  I know
it is, but really, can anything of the natural world explain the supernatural?
(This is why revelation is necessary to the authors of the Bible.)

The Spirit is part of God.  How much closer to the source can you get?
The Greek in 2 Timothy which is sometimes translated as "inspired by God", 
literally means "God-breathed".  In other words, God spoke the actual words 
into the scriptures.  Many theologians and Bible scholars (Dr. James Boice is 
one that I can remember off-hand) get quite annoyed by the dryness and 
incompleteness of "inspired by God".

That's what the verse taken from 2 Timothy was all about.  The continuity of a 
book written over a span of 1500 years by more than 40 authors from all walks 
of life is a testimony to the single authorship of God.

What source to you claim to have discovered which has information of superior
historicity to the Bible?  Certainly not Josephus' writings, or the writings 
of the Gnostics which were third century, at the earliest.

Jesus was fully God as well.  That's why I'd assert that he is wise.

Please rethink this last paragraph.  If there is no God, which seems to be your
current belief, then Jesus was either a liar or a complete nut because not
only did he assert that God exists, but he claimed to be God himself!  (regards
to C.S. Lewis)  How then could you have the least bit of respect for Jesus?
	In conclusion, be careful about logically unfounded hypotheses based
on gut feelings about the text and other scholars' unsubstantiated claims.  
The Bible pleads that we take it in its entirety or throw the whole book out.
	About your reading of the Bible, not only does the Spirit inspire the
writers, but he guides the reader as well.  We cannot understand it in the 
least without the Spirit's guidance:

	"For to us God revealed them through the Spirit; for the Spirit 
	searches all things, even the depths of God."  (1 Cor 2:10, NAS)
 
Peace and may God guide us in wisdom.

[Other theologians get quite annoyed at the misleadingess of
"God-breathed."  It's true that the Greek word has as its roots "God"
and "breath".  However etymology doesn't necessarily tell you what a
word means.  Otherwise, "goodbye" would be a religious expression
(since it comes from "God be with ye").  You have to look at how the
word was actually used.  In this case the word is used for wisdom or
dreams that come from God.  But "God-breathed" is an overtranslation.

A friend of mine managed to get a copy of a computerised Greek and Hebrew 
Lexicon called "The Word Perfect" (That is not the word processing 
package WordPerfect). However, some one wiped out the EXE file, and she 
has not been able to restore it. There are no distributors of the package in 
South Africa. I would appreciate it, if some one could email me the file, or 
at least tell me where I could get it from. 

My email address is
	fortmann@superbowl.und.ac.za     or
	fortmann@shrike.und.ac.za
 
Many thanks.

In Him, Paul Fortmann

   I guess I would react rather strongly to this line of thinking carried 
out!  When you think "your army" is stronger than "mine", you would 
"righteously" take my children and baptize them, doing what you know is 
really "best" for them.
   You cannot possibly put this kind of action, nor the crusades into the 
context of the teachings of Jesus/God.  I think he advocated a different 
approach that was *by design* made to be appealing, to those called by him, 
not chosen by a church practice.
   It seems to me you have the cause and effect switched, the change comes 
and then you get baptized.

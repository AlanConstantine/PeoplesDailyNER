Hi Bruce.  How do you reconcile this practice with Ezekiel 18?
Ezekiel 18:20 "The soul who sins is the one who will die.  The son will not
share the guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the
son.  The righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and
the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him."

Is Ezekiel 18 not translated correctly in your eyes perhaps?

Sincerely,

Aaron Cardenas

P.S. I too am bothered to see offensive words being posted on this
newsgroup.  Obscenity is out of place for anyone who wants to live by the
Bible (Eph 5:4).

Moderator:  I would appreciate your not letting posts with foul language
through, which has happened at least twice lately.  Thank you.

[I try to avoid foul language.  Bastard is certainly foul language
when shouted at someone as an insult.  But in this case it was being
used in its original technical sense.  Similarly, hell is an obscenity
in some contexts, but not when referring to the afterlife.  It is not
clear to me that bastard is foul language when it's being used in its
proper meaning.  One of today's postings quotes Deut 23:2.  Am I
to prohibit that?  --clh]

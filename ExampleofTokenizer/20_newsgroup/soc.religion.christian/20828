Greetings,

Probably a tired old horse, but...  maybe with a slightly different
twist.  I wanted to know if there are any good English-language texts
for learning ancient Hebrew, and how these compare with German
educational texts qualitywise, if anybody has an idea.  I can't figure
out if I should buy one here for later study or wait until I get back to
the U.S.

Something I find interesting about studying theology in Germany is the
fact that the students get their ancient language-learning out of the
way early [I'm not a theology student, but I spend a lot of time with
such folks] in their careers.  They take the first two years or so to just
do Greek and Latin and Hebrew [possibly Aramaic, too--who knows].
What's it like at divinity schools or seminaries in the States?  Is
there a lot of language instruction done?  I really don't have a basis
for comparison.

Regards, Phil

[For better of worse, we don't have the tradition of classical
education in the U.S., so generally if a seminary believes students
should know Greek, they have to teach it.  It's common for seminaries
to require at least a semester each of Hebrew and Greek, though of
course more is required for serious scholarship.  --clh]

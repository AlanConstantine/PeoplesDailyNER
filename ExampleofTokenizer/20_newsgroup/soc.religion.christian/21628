You are right, Michael.

In John 3:5, Jesus says, "Amen, amen, I say to you, no one can enter the
kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit."  That's really what
He said, and He meant it.  That verse is the definition of baptism.  I don't
have the law book in front of me, but there is a canon law that urges
parents to baptize their children within one week of birth for the very
reason that you state.

From time to time I have made reference to a book called "The Two Babylons"
which is a book written by Alexander Hislop (mid 1800's) about the Babylonian
mystery religion and its flight through history.  I was unable to put it down
the first time I read it, but others have found it dry.  It has numberable
references and illustrations.  If you are interested in purchasing your own
copy, you can call Moody Book Store @ (312)329-4352 and order it for $16.99 and
they will ship it to you.   
  It is a good book just to get the reference titles for your own digs into the
mystery religions.  I have found it invaluable for that purpose alone.  But for
those who only want to skim the subject, it comes highly recommended.  
  Just a note to my RC brothers and sisters.  You may find this to be a
diatribe or you may find it to be a test to the origin and true nature of the
origin of RCism.  If you are offended by anything that asks hard questions
about your denomination (as to whether or not it is "Christian") then perhaps
you should just passover this offer.  To those who are a little more
adventurous, go for it and later, please contact me with you reasons pro or con
on the scholorship of this book.  I really would be interested.

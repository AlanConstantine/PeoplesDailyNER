On Sunday 9 May 1993, Kenneth Engel writes (in substance):

  We are told that the penalty for sin is an eternity in Hell.
  We are told that Jesus paid the penalty, suffering in our stead.
  But Jesus did not spend an eternity in Hell.

This objection presupposes the "forensic substitution" theory of the
Atonement. Not everyone who believes in the Atonement understands it
in those terms. For an expansion of this statement, send the
messages
   GET GEN04 RUFF
   GET GEN05 RUFF
   GET GEN06 RUFF
   GET GEN07 RUFF
  to LISTSERV@ASUACAD.BITNET or to LISTSERV@ASUVM.INRE.ASU.EDU

Note that the character after the "GEN" is a zero. If you want to
read my opun from the beginning, start with GEN01.

 Yours,
 James Kiefer

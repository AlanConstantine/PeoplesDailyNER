I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the net.
My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in schism
or legitimately excommunicated.  But that's really beside the point.
What does the Roman Catholic church say?  Excommunication can be
real apart from formal excommunication, as provided for in canon law.

After all we Orthodox don't cinsider ourselves schismatic or
excommunicated.  But the Catholic Church considers us dissident.

If this is inappropriate for this group or beyond the charter,
I'm sure OFM will let us know.

[I think it's within the charter.  Whether this is actually the best
group in which to discuss it is up to the people concerned.  I am not
interested in having this reinvoke the general Catholic/Protestant
polemics, but I don't see why it should -- the issue is primarily one
specific to Catholics.  --clh]

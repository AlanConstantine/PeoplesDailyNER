No, IMO, Mr. Stowell missed the point.

Mr. Stowell seems to have jumped rather strangely from truth to absolutes.
I don't see how that necessarily follows.  

Are all truths also absolutes?
Is all of scripture truths (and therefore absolutes)?

If the answer to either of these questions is no, then perhaps you can 
explain to me how you determine which parts of Scripture are truths, and
which truths are absolutes.  And, who is qualified to make these 
determinations?  There is hardly consensus, even in evangelical 
Christianity (not to mention the rest of Christianity) regarding 
Biblical interpretation.

I find Mr. Stowell's statement terribly simple-minded.

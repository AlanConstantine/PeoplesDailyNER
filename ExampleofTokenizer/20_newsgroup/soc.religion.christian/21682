Let me salute Gary Chin for speaking the gospel which is our source
of life.  Any who will follow his example, and accept the priorities
Christ commands of us, that the weightier matters of the law are justice
and mercy and good faith, is my brother or sister in Christ, and I will
attend to such a person with humility and charity.  We may not, in the
end, agree -- siblings often don't -- but we can at least talk.

i'd just like to repeat and emphasize that because someone else is
trying to make you feel horrible and worthless does not mean that you
should feel that way, although that's easier to say than believe
sometimes.  remember, God made you and loves you, so he must think
you're something special.  (excuse the trite language here.)  also,
the bully may just be someone who is mean for no reason -- not out of
intentional mental torture.  has anyone else been harassed?  maybe
they're just not talking about it.  

i would have emailed but my reactions weren't fast enough and the post
i'm responding to didn't include your address.  just take courage and
remember that all of us on the net are rooting for you.

take care!
vera

Are the Serbs doing the work of God?  Hmm...

I've been wondering if anyone would ever ask the question,

Are the governments of the United States and Europe not moving
to end the ethnic cleansing by the Serbs because the targets are
muslims?

Can/Does God use those who are not following him to accomplish
tasks for him?  Esp those tasks that are punative?

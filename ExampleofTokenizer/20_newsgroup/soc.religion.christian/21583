Ok, what's more important to gay Christians?  Sex, or Christianity?
Christianity I would hope.  Would they be willing to forgo sex
completely, in order to avoid being a stumbling block to others,
to avoid the chance that their interpretation might be wrong,
etc?  If not, why not?  Heterosexuals abstain all the time.
(It would be nice if protestant churches had celibate orders
to show the world that sex is not the important thing in life)

To tell the truth, gay churches remind me a lot of Henry the VIII
starting the Church of England in order to get a divorce (or is
this a myth).  Note that I am not denying that gay Christians are
Christian.

Fine, but one of the points of this entire discussion is that "we"
(conservative, reformed christians - this could start an argument...
But isn't this idea that homosexuality is ok fairly "new" [this
century] ? Is there any support for this being a viable viewpoint
before this century? I don't know.) don't believe that homosexuality
is "acceptable to Him". So your scripture quotation doesn't work for
"us".

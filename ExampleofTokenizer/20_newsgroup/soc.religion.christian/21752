I remember a couple of times when my ex-girlfriend said that she thought she
was blessed because of her son (whom she loved dearly). In fact, I've heard
people refer to someone as being blessed quite a few times. It's a common
figure of speech. Considering that Elizabeth was just another human, I think
this passage offers nothing towards justifying the "blessedness" of Mary.

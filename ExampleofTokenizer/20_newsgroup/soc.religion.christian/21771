Luke 10:16-18

He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth
 me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me.

And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the
 devils are subject unto us through thy name.

And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.

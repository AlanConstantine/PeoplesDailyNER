One day a few years ago Franky Schaeffer walked into a Greek Orthodox
Church.  He is now an Orthodox Christian.  So is his mother and if his
father, Fransis Schaeffer, had not passed away he too would have come
into the church.  
Franky, like many Americans who have recently found the Orthodox church,
described the experience as finally coming home after a long jouney
through a desert.  You should also read the book "Becoming Orthodox" by
Peter Gillquist.  It describes the long journey of some 2000 weary
Evangelical Protestants to the Orthodox church.   Come taste and see how
good the Lord is.

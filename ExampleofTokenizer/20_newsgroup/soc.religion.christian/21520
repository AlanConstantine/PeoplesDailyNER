	My feeling on baptism is this:  parents baptize their baby so that the
	baby has the sanctifying grace of baptism (and thus removal of original
	sin) on its soul in the event of an unexpected death.
	
	That is, the parents speak on behalf of the child which is too young
	to speak on its own.  This should not surprise anyone:  don't parents
	*always* do what they believe is the best for their baby?  Why would
	that apply to the baby's physical needs only but not his/her spiritual
	needs to have God's grace?
	
	The purpose of confirmation is for the baby (now young adult) to 
	decide to re-affirm for himself/herself the promises that his/her
	parents made at baptism.  That is where accepting Jesus into your
	heart comes in.  In baptism, the parents ask Jesus to come into their
	baby's heart; at confirmation the child repeats that request 
	independently.
	
	(By the way, these are my personal feelings, though I believe they are
	pretty close to what the doctrinal position of the Catholic Church on
	this issue.  Can anyone out there back me up or correct me?

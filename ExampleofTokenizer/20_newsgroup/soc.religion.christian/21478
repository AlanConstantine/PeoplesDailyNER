"the only reason, " etc on as tough nut to crack as the death penalty
reallly doesn't help much.

Every year the FBI releases crime stats showing an overwhelming amount of
crime is committed by repeat offenders. People are killed by folks who
have killed (who knows how many times) before. How aobut folks who are for
the death penalty, not for revenge, but to cut down on recidivism?]

  Your point is well taken. I acknowledge the fact that there are some who
take this position. Sorry about that. Of course, I still believe that the
vast majority of those who favor the death penalty, do so for reason of
seeking vengeance. I'm curious, if you favor the death penalty to keep
killers from killing again, what do you think we should do with people who
commit other crimes, such as rape or robbery? Isn't it the Muslims who
cut your hand off if you're caught stealing?

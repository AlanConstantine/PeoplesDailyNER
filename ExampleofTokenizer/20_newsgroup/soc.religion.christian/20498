Jayne stands in pretty good company.  C.S. Lewis wrote a whole book
promoting the idea contained in her first sentence quoted above.  It is
called "The Final Divorce".  Excellent book on the subject of Heaven and
Hell, highly recommended.  It's an allegory of souls who are invited, indeed
beseeched to enter Heaven, but reject the offer because being with God in
Heaven means giving up their false pride.

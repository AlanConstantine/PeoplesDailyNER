>>Can't someone describe someone's Trinity in simple declarative
>>sentences with words that have common meaning?

When I need a kick-butt God, or when I need assurance of the reality
of truth, I pray to God the Father.

When I need a friend, someone to put his arm around me and
cry with me, I pray to Jesus.

When I need strength or wisdom to get through a difficult situation,
I pray for the Holy Spirit.

I realize that the above will probably make some people cringe,
but what can I say? I think the doctrine of the trinity is
an attempt to reconcile Jesus being God and being distinct from
God, as described in the Bible.

I wonder if Jesus had been a Hindu how different the wording would be.

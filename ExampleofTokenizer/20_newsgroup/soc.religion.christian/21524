Yes, I suppose that's true.  Of course, notice I qualified with NEARLY
every language :-).  And there are missionaries out there who can
speak every imaginable language AND dialect.  But then, the fact that
not all languages have a WRITTEN gospel lends no credence to the 
concept of "pentecost" type xenoglossolalia since most tongues occur not
in these places of un-written language, but rather in churches full
of people who do have a written language and a Bible in that language.

But I nitpick.

Well, it's that time of year again here at IU:  graduation.
Unfortunately, this means that I am out of here, more than likely for
good.  I cannot say if I'll be in here under another username or not, or
even if I'll ever get back in here at all.  I am leaving this part of my
ministry to another brother, John Right.  So, have fun and remember that
flaming can be considered slander.

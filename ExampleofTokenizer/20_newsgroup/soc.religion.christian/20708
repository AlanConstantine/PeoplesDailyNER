This is a ridiculous argument for being a Christian.  So then, you might 
consider switching from Christianity to another religion if you were 
offered an even more frightening description of another hell?  How many
Christians do think there are who view it strictly as an insurance policy?
Not many I know; they believe in a message of love and compassion for 
others.  A faith based on fear of hell sounds like a dysfunctional 
relationship with God.  Like a child who cringes in fear of a parent's
physical violence.  

Many religions have concrete views of heaven and hell, with various
threats and persuasions regarding who will go where.  Competition over
who can envison the worst hell can hardly nurture the idea of loving
your neighbor as yourself.

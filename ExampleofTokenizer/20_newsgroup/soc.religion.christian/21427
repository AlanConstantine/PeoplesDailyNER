This is a point that seems to have been overlooked by many. The ending of a 
1600 year old schism seems to be in sight.

The theologians said that the differences between them were fundamentally 
ones or terminology, and that the Christological faith of both groups was 
the same.

Some parishes have concelebrated the Eucharist, and here in Southern Africa 
we are running a joint theological training course for Coptic and Byzantine 
Orthodox. 

There are still several things to be sorted out, however. As far as the 
Copts are concerned, there were three ecumenical councils, whily the 
Byzantine Orthodox acknowledge seven.

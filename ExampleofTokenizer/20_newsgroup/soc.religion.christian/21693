This has troubled me for a long time and needs to be dealt with.

From a long article Available through an individual on this newsgroup.

About scripture being against homosexuality:
------------------------------------------
When we  are
less homophobic we will see that what we know as gay and lesbian  people,
engaging in loving, voluntary erotic relations with each other, aren't  even
mentioned. [in the Bible, tk]
------------------------------------------

This frightens me (not in the homophobic sense, but intellectually),
especially because it was written by someone from a homosexual church.

So, if my interpretation is different than theirs, I am homophobic!  This
can't be right. Disagreement in interpretation of the Bible and/or rejection
of homosexual acts is not tantamount of homophobia.

	Two follow up's to Mark's last posting:

	1.  As far as current investigations, the Church recently declared the
	    crying statue and corresponding messages from Mary at Akita,
	    Japan as approved (I found this out about a month ago.)

	2.  Again in the proof department, start with the appearances of Mary
	    at Fatima.  Among other things, there were pictures taken of the
	    "miracle of the sun" that appeared in some major American newspaper
	    (The New York Times, I believe) as well as most of the major
	    European newspapers.  

	    I could talk (or post) for hours on this topic, but... 
		(I have a thesis to write).
